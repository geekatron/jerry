# File Organization Standards

> **CONSOLIDATED:** File organization rules are now in `architecture-standards.md`.

See [Architecture Standards](architecture-standards.md) for:
- Directory structure (hexagonal layers)
- Project workspace layout
- One-class-per-file rule (H-10)
- CQRS file naming conventions
- Naming conventions for ports, adapters, commands, queries, handlers, events
