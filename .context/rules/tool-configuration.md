# Tool Configuration Standards

> **CONSOLIDATED:** Tool configuration rules are now in `testing-standards.md`.

Relevant rules: H-20 (BDD test-first), H-21 (90% line coverage).

See [Testing Standards](testing-standards.md) for:
- pytest configuration (markers, coverage thresholds)
- mypy strict mode settings
- ruff linting and formatting rules

See `pyproject.toml` for authoritative tool configuration values.
