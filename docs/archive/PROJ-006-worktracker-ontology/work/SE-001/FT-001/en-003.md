## Research Questions

1. What issue types exist in JIRA? (Epic, Story, Task, Bug, Sub-task, etc.)
2. What are the standard and custom fields?
3. What workflow states and transitions exist?
4. How are issues linked (blocks, is blocked by, relates to)?
5. What is the hierarchy (Epic → Story → Sub-task)?
6. What are JIRA Cloud vs Server differences?

## Domain Model Template

```markdown
## JIRA Domain Model

### 1. Entity Catalog

| Entity | Description | Hierarchy Level |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Epic | Large body of work | Top |
| Story | User requirement | Mid |
| Task | Work item | Mid |
| Bug | Defect | Mid |
| Sub-task | Child work item | Bottom |

### 2. Issue Hierarchy

```
Epic (issuetype: Epic)
├── Story (Epic Link)
│   └── Sub-task (Parent Link)
├── Task (Epic Link)
│   └── Sub-task (Parent Link)
└── Bug (Epic Link)
    └── Sub-task (Parent Link)
```

### 3. Standard Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| key | string | yes | Project key + number (e.g., PROJ-123) |
| summary | string | yes | Issue title |
| description | text | no | Issue description |
| status | status | yes | Current workflow state |
| priority | priority | no | Priority level |
| assignee | user | no | Assigned user |
| reporter | user | yes | Creator |
| labels | string[] | no | Tags |
| components | component[] | no | Components |
| fixVersions | version[] | no | Target versions |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 4. Link Types

| Link Type | Inward | Outward |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Blocks | is blocked by | blocks |
| Clones | is cloned by | clones |
| Duplicate | is duplicated by | duplicates |
| Relates | relates to | relates to |

### 5. Default Workflow

```
[To Do] → [In Progress] → [In Review] → [Done]
    ↑           │
    └───────────┘ (reopen)
```

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|-----|---------|
| To Do | In Progress | Start work |
| In Progress | In Review | Submit for review |
| In Progress | To Do | Return to backlog |
| In Review | Done | Approve |
| In Review | In Progress | Request changes |
```

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All 6 tasks completed with evidence
2. Research document captures all JIRA issue types
3. Domain model includes standard and custom field patterns
4. Workflow variations documented
