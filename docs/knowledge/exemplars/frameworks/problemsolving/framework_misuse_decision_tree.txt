FRAMEWORK MISUSE DECISION TREE (CLI)

Is there active danger/harm/security breach?
- YES: CHAOTIC MODE
  Stabilize first. Reduce blast radius. Establish control. Then reclassify.
- NO:
  Do we have a known playbook with high success?
  - YES: SIMPLE MODE (best practices)
  - NO:
    Can experts analyze cause-effect reliably?
    - YES: COMPLICATED MODE (expert analysis + tests)
    - NO: COMPLEX MODE (safe-to-fail probes + learn)

Common misuse:
- RCA in chaos -> stabilize first
- Best practices in complexity -> probe & measure
- Improvisation forever -> turn into engineering
- Brainstorm + judge -> separate diverge/converge
