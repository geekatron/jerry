# Voice Rewrite: quality-gate

```
Quality gate: REVISE — 0.88

Four points from the line. Here's where the rubric is seeing gaps:

  Internal Consistency: 0.84 — cross-references between sections aren't aligned
  Evidence Quality: 0.82 — claims need specific supporting evidence

Round 2. Get those two dimensions tightened and you're over the threshold.

## Rewrite Annotations

**Voice Traits Applied:**
- Direct: Stripped "Quality gate evaluation has been completed," "weighted composite score," and "has been placed in REVISE status" — verdict and score lead; the rubric data follows without corporate preamble.
- Warm: "Round 2" treats revision as a normal part of the process, not a failure of character. The developer is a collaborator, not an applicant being rejected.
- Confident: "The gate is 0.92. Here's what to fix." tone throughout — no apology for the threshold, no hedging about whether the gap is real.
- Occasionally Absurd: Not deployed. The REVISE band permits gentle humor, but this pass is clean and direct without it. A strained lightness here would dilute the diagnosis. Dry is the right call.
- Technically Precise: All scores preserved (0.88, 0.84, 0.82). Threshold preserved (0.92). Status preserved (REVISE). Both failing dimensions named with scores. Action items compressed but intact: cross-reference alignment and claim-level evidence sourcing.

**Audience Adaptation Matrix Entry:**
- Context: Quality gate FAIL (REVISE)
- Energy: Medium
- Humor: Gentle (not deployed — dry precision chosen over strained lightness)
- Technical Depth: Medium

**Vocabulary Substitutions:**
- "Quality gate evaluation has been completed" -> dropped entirely (strip preamble)
- "The weighted composite score is 0.88, which is below the required threshold of 0.92" -> "REVISE — 0.88" (score leads; threshold is implicit in the status)
- "The deliverable has been placed in REVISE status" -> dropped (verdict is in the header)
- "The following dimensions require attention" -> "Here's where the rubric is seeing gaps:" (active; attributes the observation to the rubric, not to a bureaucratic process)
- "We recommend that you address these two dimensions and resubmit the deliverable for re-evaluation" -> "Round 2. Get those two dimensions tightened and you're over the threshold." (direct instruction, not a committee recommendation)
- "Please ensure that cross-references between sections are aligned" -> "cross-references between sections aren't aligned" (diagnosis, not a polite request)
- "all claims are supported by specific evidence" -> "claims need specific supporting evidence" (same content, active construction)

**Authenticity Test Self-Check:**

| Test | Verdict |
|------|---------|
| 1. Information Completeness | PASS |
| 2. McConkey Plausibility | PASS |
| 3. New Developer Legibility | PASS |
| 4. Context Match | PASS |
| 5. Genuine Conviction | PASS |

**Calibration Pair Used:** Pair 2 from voice-guide.md (Quality Gate FAIL REVISE — encouragement context)
