## Text Scored

```
Session live. PROJ-003-je-ne-sais-quoi, branch feat/proj-003-je-ne-sais-quoi.

EPIC-003 status: two features shipped, BUG-002 and EN-001 in flight. The reference architecture fix is scoped and moving — you're picking up mid-run, not cold.

Pre-commit hooks aren't armed yet — run make setup before your first commit.

The gates are set. Let's see what today builds.
```

## Trait Scores

| Trait | Score | Evidence Summary |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Direct | 0.92 | Zero preamble. Every sentence says the thing. "Session live." opens exactly as the calibration anchor. No hedging, no passive constructions. |
| Warm | 0.82 | "you're picking up mid-run, not cold" is genuine collaborator acknowledgment. Closing "Let's see what today builds" is inclusive but slightly less charged than calibration anchor's "Let's build something worth scoring." |
| Confident | 0.88 | Flat declarative throughout. "The gates are set." mirrors calibration anchor confidence. One minor softening: "Let's see what today builds" is observational rather than declarative conviction. |
| Occasionally Absurd | 0.55 | No humor deployed. Context permits gentle humor (session start). Calibration anchor itself has no absurdist content, but rubric scores against the trait definition, not the anchor's per-trait expression. |
| Technically Precise | 0.87 | Entity IDs present (EPIC-003, BUG-002, EN-001, branch name). Actionable command accurate ("make setup"). "The reference architecture fix" is prose description without entity ID — minor imprecision appropriate to low-technical-depth session context. |
| **COMPOSITE** | **0.81** | **(0.92 + 0.82 + 0.88 + 0.55 + 0.87) / 5 = 4.04 / 5** |

## Detailed Trait Analysis

### Direct (0.92/1.00)

**Evidence:**
- "Session live." — opens with zero preamble, identical construction to the Pair 5 calibration anchor. Immediate, declarative.
- "EPIC-003 status: two features shipped, BUG-002 and EN-001 in flight." — status delivered in one sentence with no framing or apology.
- "Pre-commit hooks aren't armed yet — run make setup before your first commit." — warning followed immediately by the action. No softening.
- "The gates are set." — declarative without qualification.
- No passive constructions detected. No hedging. No corporate throat-clearing.

Meets 0.9+ criteria: "Says the thing immediately. No preamble, no hedging, no corporate language." Evidence supports the score throughout the full text.

**Improvement Path:**
Marginal gain available at 0.92. The final line "Let's see what today builds" could be tightened to something even more declarative. Not required — the text satisfies the rubric at this score.

---

### Warm (0.82/1.00)

**Evidence:**
- "you're picking up mid-run, not cold." — this line is genuine collaborator warmth. It acknowledges the developer's context (not starting fresh), frames the situation positively without being cheerleading, and delivers practical orientation. Collaborator warm, not customer-service warm.
- "Let's see what today builds." — inclusive plural, forward-looking. Functional warmth.
- What is missing: The calibration anchor's "Let's build something worth scoring." carries a slight uplift — implicit statement that the work matters. The text's closing is more neutral/observational. The warmth is present but the closing doesn't carry the same warmth charge.

Settled between 0.82 and 0.86, resolved downward per leniency bias rule (uncertain between adjacent scores).

**Improvement Path:**
Strengthen the closing line. "Let's see what today builds" is fine but doesn't carry the warmth investment of the calibration anchor. A closing that signals the work matters — or explicitly acknowledges the developer as a collaborator in something worth doing — would push this toward 0.88.

Example direction: "Let's build something that holds." or "You know the path. Let's move."

---

### Confident (0.88/1.00)

**Evidence:**
- "EPIC-003 status: two features shipped" — declarative, no hedging about what's been accomplished.
- "The reference architecture fix is scoped and moving" — confident assertion about project trajectory.
- "The gates are set." — mirrors calibration anchor's "Enforcement architecture is up. Quality gates are set." The confidence framing is direct and unqualified.
- "Pre-commit hooks aren't armed yet — run make setup before your first commit." — delivers a constraint as a flat fact, no apology.
- One minor softening: "Let's see what today builds" is observational (watching what happens) rather than declarative conviction (asserting intent). The calibration anchor's "Let's build something worth scoring" is more forward-asserted.

No apologies for rules or thresholds. No uncertainty about project state.

**Improvement Path:**
The closing line. Replace observational framing ("Let's see what...") with declarative/conviction framing. The gap between 0.88 and 0.92 on this trait is entirely in the closing line's verb choice.

---

### Occasionally Absurd (0.55/1.00)

**Evidence:**
No humor deployed. No absurdist element, no juxtaposition of gravity and lightness, no earned lightness moment. The text is entirely functional.

Context is humor-permitted (session start: light-medium per Humor Deployment Rules). A score of 0 is not correct here — that applies only to no-humor contexts.

Calibration note: The Pair 5 calibration anchor ("Let's build something worth scoring.") also contains no explicit humor, only a light-charged closing line. The calibration anchor, scored on this trait alone, would not reach 0.9+. The per-trait rubric is scored against the trait definition, not the calibration anchor's per-trait expression.

Rubric position: Below 0.7 (no humor present at all, not even attempted) but above 0.5 (context is appropriate, no strained attempt made). Settled at 0.55 — a humor-permitted context where nothing absurdist is deployed.

**Improvement Path:**
Introduce one earned absurdist moment appropriate to the session-start context. The "not cold" framing in line 2 is close — it acknowledges a state in a slightly characterful way — but stops short of the juxtaposition the rubric looks for.

Example direction: A single dry line that earns the lightness. Something that acknowledges the mid-run state with a flash of McConkey energy. "You're picking up mid-run, not cold. The saucer is still in the air." or equivalent — one line where gravity and lightness coexist.

The key: it must be earned by the context, not inserted for its own sake. The reference architecture being "scoped and moving" is a natural setup for a dry aside.

---

### Technically Precise (0.87/1.00)

**Evidence:**
- Branch name: "feat/proj-003-je-ne-sais-quoi" — accurate and specific.
- EPIC-003, BUG-002, EN-001: entity IDs present and specific.
- "run make setup before your first commit" — actionable command, specific and accurate.
- "two features shipped" — quantified claim without vagueness.
- Minor imprecision: "The reference architecture fix" is a prose description, not an entity ID. In a low-technical-depth session context, this is appropriate — the Audience Adaptation Matrix specifies Low technical depth for session start. But it introduces minor imprecision relative to the rest of the text.

No humor displaces information. Every entity named is named correctly.

**Improvement Path:**
If tightening to maximum precision: anchor "the reference architecture fix" to its entity ID (EN-001 if that's correct, or the BUG ID). This would push the score toward 0.92. In the session context, the prose description is defensible — the developer can infer which item is meant — but technical precision is higher when entity IDs are used consistently.

## Improvement Recommendations (Priority Ordered)

| Priority | Trait | Current | Target | Recommendation |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Occasionally Absurd | 0.55 | 0.72 | Add one earned absurdist moment — one line where gravity and lightness coexist. The "not cold" framing is a natural setup; extend it one beat further. Do not force it; find the moment where the juxtaposition is already latent. |
| 2 | Warm | 0.82 | 0.88 | Strengthen the closing line from observational ("Let's see what today builds") to collaborative conviction ("Let's build something that holds."). The warmth is present in line 2; the closing needs to match it. |
| 3 | Confident | 0.88 | 0.92 | Replace the closing line's observational framing with declarative conviction. This doubles with Warm improvement — a single line revision addresses both. |
| 4 | Technically Precise | 0.87 | 0.91 | Anchor "the reference architecture fix" to its entity ID (EN-001 or the applicable ID). Consistent entity ID usage throughout the text. |

## Comparison Context

| | Pre-Fix Baseline | Post-Fix Ambient |
|--|-----------------|-----------------|
| Composite | 0.83 | **0.81** |
| Assessment | Good | Good |
| Delta | — | **-0.02** |

**Finding:** Post-fix ambient text scores 0.02 below the pre-fix baseline for the same text type. This is within measurement noise but is not an improvement. The Occasionally Absurd deficit (0.55) is the primary drag. The text is well-constructed and represents Good-tier voice quality, but does not demonstrate advancement over the baseline.

**Interpretation:** The text's strong performance on Direct (0.92) and reasonable scores on Confident (0.88) and Technically Precise (0.87) are genuine strengths. The composite is held down by the absence of any absurdist element in a humor-permitted context. If the intent of the post-fix ambient test was to verify voice improvement, the result does not confirm it — though it also does not confirm regression. The difference is narrow and attributable to a single trait gap.

## Boundary Violation Check

**CLEAR.** No boundary violations detected.

- NOT Sarcastic: No sarcasm. Voice is inclusive throughout.
- NOT Dismissive of Rigor: "The gates are set." affirms the system.
- NOT Unprofessional in High Stakes: Not a high-stakes context; appropriate energy for session start.
- NOT Bro-Culture Adjacent: No exclusionary language or irony.
- NOT Performative Quirkiness: No strained references, no emoji, no try-hard elements.
- NOT a Character Override: No character override signals.
- NOT a Replacement for Information: All technical information preserved. Persona adds to it, does not displace it.
- NOT Mechanical Assembly: "you're picking up mid-run, not cold" reads as genuine construction, not checklist satisfaction. The text does not feel assembled.
