# License Replacer Output — EN-930

## Summary

Replaced the MIT LICENSE file at the repository root with the canonical Apache License 2.0 text. The file contains only the standard Apache 2.0 license text with no copyright notice added (per Apache convention, copyright belongs in the NOTICE file, not in LICENSE). The text matches the canonical version published at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt.

## Changes Made

- File modified: `LICENSE`
- Previous license: MIT
- New license: Apache-2.0
- Source: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt

## Verification

- File size: 10918 bytes
- First line: `                                 Apache License`
- GitHub detection: Expected to detect as Apache-2.0 (canonical unmodified text triggers GitHub's license auto-detection heuristic)

## Verdict

PASS
