## Summary

The transcript pipeline integration test `test_all_datasets_complete_under_30_seconds` fails with `AssertionError: Expected to process 6 datasets, only processed 0`. The test expects 6 test datasets to be available but finds none.

**Key Details:**
- **Symptom:** 0 of 6 expected datasets found
- **Frequency:** Every CI run (100%)
- **Workaround:** None — blocks CI

---

## Reproduction Steps

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone repository fresh
2. Run `uv run pytest tests/integration/transcript/test_pipeline.py::TestPythonPipeline::test_all_datasets_complete_under_30_seconds`

### Expected Result

Test finds 6 datasets and processes them.

### Actual Result

```
AssertionError: Expected to process 6 datasets, only processed 0
```

## Environment

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Operating System** | Ubuntu 24.04 (GitHub Actions) |
| **Runtime** | Python 3.11-3.14 (all versions) |
| **CI Job** | Test pip/uv (all variants) |

## Root Cause Analysis

### Root Cause

To be determined. The test datasets may be:
1. Not committed to git (gitignored or in a separate location)
2. Expected in a directory that doesn't exist in CI
3. Generated by a setup step that's missing

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Fix Verification

- [ ] Test finds and processes all expected datasets
- [ ] Or test is updated to work with available datasets / skip gracefully
- [ ] Fix works across Python 3.11-3.14
