## Summary

Add a disclaimer to the project documentation noting that skill and agent definitions are not yet optimized and that optimization is planned for upcoming releases. This addresses the acknowledged technical debt in definition quality.

**Technical Scope:**
- Add disclaimer to README.md or relevant documentation
- Reference roadmap for optimization work
- Set user expectations about current definition quality

---

## Problem Statement

The skill and agent definitions are described as "chunky and not necessarily following best practices." Without a disclaimer, users may perceive this as an oversight rather than a known trade-off with planned remediation.

---

## Business Value

Transparency about known limitations builds trust and sets expectations. Users understand that optimization is planned, reducing frustration with current definition verbosity.

### Features Unlocked

- Clear optimization roadmap communication
- User trust through transparency

---

## Technical Approach

1. Add "Known Limitations" or "Roadmap" section to README.md
2. Include note about skill/agent definition optimization being planned
3. Reference future release timeline (general, not date-specific)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Disclaimer added to documentation (README or dedicated section)
- [ ] Disclaimer mentions skill/agent definitions are not yet optimized
- [ ] Disclaimer states optimization is on the roadmap for upcoming releases
- [ ] No specific dates or release numbers promised

**Transcript Citation:**
> "So we would like to put a disclaimer that is in the roadmap to ensure that the skills and agent definitions are optimized."
