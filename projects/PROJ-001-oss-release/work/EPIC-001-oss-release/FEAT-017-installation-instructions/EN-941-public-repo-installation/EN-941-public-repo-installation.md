## Summary

Document the future public repository installation path where users can directly add Jerry to the Claude Code marketplace from the public GitHub repository. This is a forward-looking documentation effort for when the repository becomes public.

**Technical Scope:**
- Document the simplified public installation path
- Mark as "Coming Soon" or "Future" until repository is public
- Include Claude Code marketplace direct add instructions

---

## Problem Statement

When the repository becomes public, users will need simple instructions for direct marketplace installation. Having documentation ready prevents a documentation gap at the moment of public release.

---

## Business Value

Proactive documentation ensures seamless transition from collaborator model to public model with zero documentation downtime.

### Features Unlocked

- Zero-friction public installation path
- Ready-to-activate documentation for public release

---

## Technical Approach

1. Create "Public Installation (Coming Soon)" section in INSTALLATION.md
2. Document simplified flow: Claude Code marketplace → Add repository URL → Install
3. Mark section as future/coming-soon until repo is public
4. Include note about when this becomes active

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Definition of Done

- [ ] INSTALLATION.md has "Public Installation" section
- [ ] Section clearly marked as future/coming-soon
- [ ] Simplified installation steps documented
- [ ] Transition note explaining when this path becomes active

**Transcript Citation:**
> "And then going forward, when we make the repository public, then people can just quite literally add that to the Claude Code marketplace and have it show up."
