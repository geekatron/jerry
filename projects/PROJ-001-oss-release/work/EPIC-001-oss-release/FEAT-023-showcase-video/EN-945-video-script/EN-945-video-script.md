## Summary

Write a 2-minute hype reel script for the Jerry Framework promotional video targeting Claude Code's 1st Birthday Party & Showcase. The script embodies the Saucer Boy (Shane McConkey) persona — technically brilliant AND wildly fun. Also prepare application materials (project description, URLs, Opus 4.6 capabilities).

**Key narrative**: Claude Code built its own quality guardrails framework. Jerry is AI governing AI, with soul.

**Delivery format**: InVideo-ready script with scene directions, narration, text overlays, and music cues.
