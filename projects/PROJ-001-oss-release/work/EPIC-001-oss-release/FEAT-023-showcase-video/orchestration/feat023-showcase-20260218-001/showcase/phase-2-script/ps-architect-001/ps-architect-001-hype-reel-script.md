## SCENE 1: Cold Open (0:00-0:15)

**VISUAL:** Black screen. Single cursor blinking in a terminal. Then -- rapid-fire: Claude Code writing Python, tests passing in green cascades, git commits flying. Camera pulls back to reveal the terminal is INSIDE another terminal. Code writing code. The inception moment lands.

**NARRATION:** "What happens when you give an AI a blank repo and say: build your own guardrails? Every line of code. Every test. Every quality gate. Claude Code didn't just use a framework. It built one."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** `CLAUDE CODE BUILT ITS OWN OVERSIGHT SYSTEM`

**MUSIC:** Low analog synth drone building tension. Think the opening seconds of "DNA." by Kendrick -- that eerie pulse before the beat drops.

**TRANSITION:** Glitch cut to black. Beat drop.

---

## SCENE 2: The Problem (0:15-0:30)

**VISUAL:** Split screen -- left side shows a context window filling up like a progress bar approaching red. Right side shows AI output degrading: clean code dissolving into hallucinated garbage. Text fragments scatter. The visual is visceral -- you can FEEL the rot.

**NARRATION:** "Here's the dirty secret of AI coding. The longer the session, the worse it gets. Context fills. Rules drift. Quality rots. Every developer knows this pain. Nobody had a fix."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** `CONTEXT ROT: THE ENEMY`

**MUSIC:** Beat drops -- heavy, aggressive. "Sabotage" energy. Distorted bass.

**TRANSITION:** Hard cut. Screen shatters.

---

## SCENE 3: What Jerry Is (0:30-1:00)

**VISUAL:** Fast-cut montage. Terminal sequences firing in rapid succession: hook validations triggering, JSON schemas loading, agents spawning. Each cut is 1-2 seconds max. Code blocks flash on screen -- constitutional constraints, quality gates, adversarial strategies. Motion graphics show the 5-layer enforcement architecture stacking up like armor plating. Hexagonal architecture diagram assembles itself piece by piece.

**NARRATION:** "So Claude built Jerry. A framework that enforces its own quality -- from the inside. Five layers of enforcement. Constitutional governance that cannot be overridden. Thirty-three agents across seven skills. Problem-solving. Orchestration. Architecture. NASA-grade systems engineering. And an adversary skill that attacks its own work before you ever see it."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** (rapid sequence, one per beat)
- `5-LAYER ENFORCEMENT`
- `33 AGENTS / 7 SKILLS`
- `CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE`
- `ADVERSARIAL SELF-REVIEW`

**MUSIC:** "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" -- Daft Punk. The vocoder kicks in on the stat montage. This is THE Jerry anthem: creator-critic-revision, each pass making it better.

**TRANSITION:** Quick cuts accelerating to match the Daft Punk rhythm. Each stat lands on a beat.

---

## SCENE 4: The Soul (1:00-1:30)

**VISUAL:** Shift in energy. Vintage ski footage -- Shane McConkey launching off a cliff in a onesie. Splitscreen with terminal output showing adversarial reviews running. The contrast is the point: dead-serious engineering wrapped in a personality that refuses to be boring. Cut to: code comments with actual humor in them. A quality score hitting 0.93 with a celebratory ASCII art. An agent named "Saucer Boy."

**NARRATION:** "But here's the thing. Shane McConkey didn't revolutionize skiing by being serious. He did it by being the best in the world -- and grinning the entire time. Jerry works the same way. Ten adversarial strategies. Red team. Devil's advocate. Steelman. Pre-mortem. It will tear its own work apart. And it'll have personality while it does it. Because if you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** `IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING FUN, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG`

**MUSIC:** Transition to "C.R.E.A.M." -- Wu-Tang. The piano loop is unmistakable. "Context Rules Everything Around Me."

**TRANSITION:** Smooth crossfade. Energy shifts from hype to confident swagger.

---

## SCENE 5: The Proof (1:30-1:50)

**VISUAL:** Numbers flying onto screen like a scoreboard. Each stat SLAMS into place with kinetic weight. Terminal running full test suite -- green checkmarks cascading. Quality score calculating in real-time: dimension by dimension, the weighted composite climbing to 0.92... 0.93... 0.94. The quality gate PASSES. Fireworks of green terminal output.

**NARRATION:** "Three thousand one hundred ninety-five tests. Passing. A quality gate at zero-point-nine-two that does not bend. Ten adversarial strategies that run before any deliverable ships. This isn't a demo. This is production."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** (stacking, each hitting like a punch)
- `3,195+ TESTS PASSING`
- `QUALITY GATE >= 0.92`
- `10 ADVERSARIAL STRATEGIES`
- `THIS IS PRODUCTION`

**MUSIC:** "Numbers on the Boards" -- Pusha T. Minimalist, hard, nothing but the numbers. The beat is pure confidence.

**TRANSITION:** Hard cut to black. One beat of silence.

---

## SCENE 6: Close (1:50-2:00)

**VISUAL:** Clean. The Jerry logo materializes from scattered code fragments assembling themselves -- the same way the framework was built, piece by piece, by Claude Code. Below it: the GitHub URL. The Apache 2.0 badge. A terminal cursor blinks, waiting. Ready for the next builder.

**NARRATION:** "Jerry. Open source. Apache 2.0. Built entirely by Claude Code. Come build with us."

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
- `JERRY FRAMEWORK`
- `APACHE 2.0 / OPEN SOURCE`
- `github.com/geekatron/jerry`

**MUSIC:** Final chord -- the Daft Punk vocoder resolving to a single sustained note. Clean. Triumphant. Done.

**TRANSITION:** Fade to black. Logo holds for 3 seconds.
