## SCENE 1: Cold Open (0:00-0:15)

**VISUAL:** Black screen. Single cursor blinking in a terminal. Then -- rapid-fire: Claude Code writing Python, tests passing in green cascades, git commits flying. Camera pulls back to reveal a second terminal framing the first. Code writing code. The inception moment lands.

**NARRATION:** "What happens when you give an AI a blank repo and say: build your own guardrails? Every line of code. Every test. Every quality gate. Claude Code didn't just use a framework. It wrote one."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** `CLAUDE CODE WROTE ITS OWN OVERSIGHT SYSTEM`

**MUSIC:** Low analog synth drone building tension. Dark, minimal, sub-bass pulse. 70 BPM. Think: single oscillator in a minor key, slowly adding harmonic overtones. Eerie. Anticipatory. The calm before detonation.

**TRANSITION:** Glitch cut to black. Beat drop.

---

## SCENE 2: The Problem (0:15-0:30)

**VISUAL:** Split screen -- left side shows a context window filling up like a progress bar approaching red. Right side shows AI output degrading: clean code dissolving into scrambled fragments. Text scatters and corrupts. The visual is visceral -- you can FEEL the rot.

**NARRATION:** "Here's the dirty secret of AI coding. The longer the session, the worse it gets. Context fills. Rules drift. Quality rots. Tools handle memory. Nobody had a fix for enforcement."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** `CONTEXT ROT: THE ENEMY`

**MUSIC:** Beat drops hard. Aggressive distorted bass, industrial edge. 130 BPM. Driving, relentless four-on-the-floor with crunching distortion layers. Pure adrenaline and urgency.

**TRANSITION:** Hard cut. Screen shatters.

---

## SCENE 3: What Jerry Is (0:30-1:00)

**VISUAL:** Fast-cut montage. Terminal sequences firing in rapid succession: hook validations triggering, JSON schemas loading, agents spawning. Each cut is 1-2 seconds max. Code blocks flash on screen -- constitutional constraints, quality gates, adversarial strategies. Motion graphics show the 5-layer enforcement architecture stacking up like armor plating. Then a clean split-screen before/after: left side shows degraded AI output at the 4-hour mark, right side shows consistent, clean output with enforcement active. The contrast is immediate.

**NARRATION:** "So Claude wrote Jerry. A framework that enforces its own quality. Five layers of enforcement. Constitutional governance that cannot be overridden. Thirty-three agents across seven skills. Problem-solving. Orchestration. Architecture. Structured requirements analysis and design reviews. And an adversary skill that attacks its own work before you ever see it. Before Jerry, four hours in and your agent forgets its own rules. After Jerry, every prompt re-enforces the same constraints, automatically."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** (rapid sequence, one per beat)
- `5-LAYER ENFORCEMENT`
- `33 AGENTS / 7 SKILLS`
- `CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE`
- `ADVERSARIAL SELF-REVIEW`

**MUSIC:** Electronic anthem. Vocoder-processed vocals, driving synth arpeggios. 128 BPM, key of F minor. Each stat lands on a beat. The energy says: relentless iteration, each pass better than the last. Creator-critic-revision in musical form.

**TRANSITION:** Quick cuts accelerating to match the rhythm. Each stat lands on a downbeat.

---

## SCENE 4: The Soul (1:00-1:30)

**VISUAL:** Shift in energy. Action sports footage -- big mountain skiing, cliff launches, fearless athleticism. Splitscreen with terminal output showing adversarial reviews running. The contrast is the point: dead-serious engineering wrapped in a personality that refuses to be boring. Cut to: code comments with actual humor in them. A quality score hitting 0.93 with celebratory ASCII art. An agent named "Saucer Boy."

**NARRATION:** "But here's the thing. Shane McConkey -- the skier who reinvented the sport by treating every cliff as a playground -- didn't change skiing by being serious. He did it by being the best in the world and grinning the entire time. Jerry works the same way. Ten adversarial strategies. Red team. Devil's advocate. Steelman. Pre-mortem. It tears its own work apart. And it has personality while it does it. Because if you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** `IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING FUN, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG`

**MUSIC:** Smooth transition to lo-fi boom-bap piano loop. 85 BPM, jazzy minor-key chords. Confident, unhurried swagger. Head-nod groove with vinyl crackle texture. The energy shifts from hype to quiet dominance.

**TRANSITION:** Smooth crossfade. Energy shifts from hype to confident swagger.

---

## SCENE 5: The Proof (1:30-1:50)

**VISUAL:** Numbers flying onto screen like a scoreboard. Each stat slams into place with kinetic weight. Terminal running full test suite -- green checkmarks cascading. Quality score calculating in real-time: dimension by dimension, the weighted composite climbing to 0.92... 0.93... 0.94. The quality gate PASSES. Burst of green terminal output.

**NARRATION:** "More than three thousand tests. Passing. A quality gate at zero-point-nine-two that does not bend. Ten adversarial strategies that run before any deliverable ships. This isn't a demo. This is production-grade code."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** (stacking, each hitting like a punch)
- `3,000+ TESTS PASSING`
- `QUALITY GATE >= 0.92`
- `10 ADVERSARIAL STRATEGIES`
- `PRODUCTION-GRADE CODE`

**MUSIC:** Minimalist, hard-hitting trap beat. 140 BPM half-time feel. Sparse -- just kick, snare, and a single menacing synth line. Nothing but the numbers. The beat is pure confidence. No filler. No decoration. Just facts.

**TRANSITION:** Hard cut to black. One beat of silence.

---

## SCENE 6: Close (1:50-2:00)

**VISUAL:** Clean. The Jerry logo materializes from scattered code fragments assembling themselves -- the same way the framework was built, piece by piece, written by Claude Code. Below it: the GitHub URL. The Apache 2.0 badge. A terminal cursor blinks, waiting. Ready for the next builder.

**NARRATION:** "Jerry. Open source. Apache 2.0. Every line written by Claude Code, directed by a human who refused to compromise. Come build with us."

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
- `JERRY FRAMEWORK`
- `APACHE 2.0 / OPEN SOURCE`
- `github.com/geekatron/jerry`

**MUSIC:** Final chord -- the anthem synth resolving to a single sustained note. Clean. Triumphant. Done.

**TRANSITION:** Fade to black. Logo holds for 3 seconds.

### Finding-Level Traceability

| # | Finding | Priority | Status | How Addressed |
|---|---------|----------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Music Licensing | P0 | FIXED | All 5 named commercial tracks replaced with mood/style descriptions specifying BPM, key, energy, and instrumentation. No copyrighted works named anywhere in the script. Production music library sourcing noted in Script Overview. |
| 2 | Attribution Overclaim | P0 | FIXED | "Built entirely by Claude Code" replaced with "wrote" throughout. Scene 1 text overlay changed to "WROTE." Scene 6 narration changed to "Every line written by Claude Code, directed by a human who refused to compromise." Human direction explicitly acknowledged. |
| 3 | Test Count Stale | P0 | FIXED | Replaced "3,195" with "More than three thousand" in narration and "3,000+" in text overlay. Verified actual count is 3,257 at time of writing. Rounded formulation handles count drift before Feb 21. |
| 4 | Audience Comprehension Gap | P0 | FIXED | Added concrete before/after in Scene 3 narration: "Before Jerry, four hours in and your agent forgets its own rules. After Jerry, every prompt re-enforces the same constraints, automatically." Visual direction updated to include before/after split-screen. |
| 5 | Competitor Erasure | P1 | FIXED | "Nobody had a fix" reframed to enforcement gap: "Tools handle memory. Nobody had a fix for enforcement." Moved to Scene 2 to establish the distinction early. |
| 6 | "NASA-Grade" Unsubstantiated | P1 | FIXED | Replaced "NASA-grade systems engineering" with functional description: "Structured requirements analysis and design reviews." Describes what the skill does without unsubstantiated standard citation. |
| 7 | McConkey Reference Niche | P1 | FIXED | Added inline grounding: "Shane McConkey -- the skier who reinvented the sport by treating every cliff as a playground." Audience now has enough context without prior knowledge. |
| 8 | "This Is Production" Defensibility | P1 | FIXED | Changed to "This is production-grade code" in both narration and text overlay. Describes quality standard rather than making a deployment claim. |
| 9 | InVideo AI Capability Assumptions | P1 | FIXED | Removed "nested terminal inception" specificity (simplified to "second terminal framing the first"). Removed "hexagonal architecture assembling itself piece by piece." Removed "vintage ski footage" requirement (changed to "action sports footage -- big mountain skiing"). Visual directions focus on mood and composition rather than complex procedural animation. |
| 10 | Scene 3 Jargon | P2 | ADDRESSED | Scene 3 text overlays kept as-is -- they are intentionally technical for the developer audience at a Claude Code birthday party. The narration provides the accessible layer. |
| 11 | Wu-Tang Appropriation | P2 | MOOT | All commercial music references removed per Finding 1. |
| 12 | Human Authorship | P2 | FIXED | Addressed by Finding 2 fix -- Scene 6 explicitly credits human direction. |
| 13 | "Governed by Itself" | P2 | N/A | Phrase does not appear in v1 or v2. Steelman addition was noted but not incorporated. |
| 14 | Version Number | P2 | FIXED | v0.2.0 added to script header metadata. |
| 15 | FEAT-023 Traceability | P2 | FIXED | FEAT-023-showcase-video added to script header metadata. |
