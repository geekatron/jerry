## Summary

**Steelman Assessment:** The v2 script represents a substantive, disciplined revision that resolves all Critical and Major findings from iteration 1. The six most consequential changes -- music licensing compliance, attribution accuracy, test count durability, before/after user outcome, competitor framing, and "NASA-grade" grounding -- are executed precisely and without overcorrection. The script now reads as production-ready in its core claims. Residual strengthening opportunities are Minor in magnitude: precision polish and one structural gap where the v2 revision log's own confidence (a before/after comparison now present in Scene 3) could be leveraged more fully in the narration's emotional landing.

**Improvement Count:** 0 Critical, 2 Major, 4 Minor

**Original Strength (v2 baseline):** Very High. The iteration 1 rejection was driven by compliance failures (licensing, attribution) and factual exposure (stale test count), not by creative or structural weakness. With those resolved, v2 enters the steelman as a genuinely strong artifact. The emotional arc is intact, the meta angle is compelling, the Saucer Boy persona is consistently deployed. No substantive weaknesses identified.

**Iteration 1 Comparison:** The iteration 1 steelman identified 1 Critical, 4 Major, and 5 Minor improvements. Of those 10, v2 has directly incorporated the equivalent improvements for the Critical and all 4 Major findings (in different form, driven by the P0/P1 finding resolution). The 5 Minor improvements from iteration 1 were either incorporated (SM-008 negation removal partially addressed), rendered moot (commercial music refs removed), or intentionally superseded (McConkey inline descriptor replaces vintage footage specificity). V2 has genuinely moved the needle; this is not a cosmetic revision.

**Recommendation:** Incorporate the 2 Major improvements identified below before downstream critique strategies proceed. Minor improvements are additive polish that strengthens the artifact toward the 0.95 target but do not change the core argument. The v2 script is the strongest achievable version of the original intent and is ready for S-002 Devil's Advocate and S-004 Pre-Mortem critique.

---

## Step 1: Deep Understanding

### Charitable Interpretation

The core thesis is unchanged from iteration 1, and it is correct: *Claude Code is the only AI coding tool that built its own quality enforcement system -- and that system works. Jerry is the living proof. The project is open source. Come use it.*

V2 executes this thesis across six scenes with tighter claim integrity than v1. The meta angle (Claude Code wrote the framework governing Claude Code) is the load-bearing creative idea, and it is still present in Scene 1's cold open and implicit in Scene 6's close.

What is new in v2 is the discipline of restraint. Every Critical and Major finding from iteration 1 was a case of the script reaching too far -- naming copyrighted tracks, claiming sole authorship without human acknowledgment, citing a specific test count that could go stale, invoking "NASA-grade" without the methodology, erasing competitors with a broad stroke. V2 corrects each of these not by weakening the claim but by finding the more defensible version of the same claim. "More than three thousand tests" is more durable than "3,195" and no less impressive. "Production-grade code" is more credible than "this is production." "Tools handle memory. Nobody had a fix for enforcement." is more precise than "nobody had a fix." This revision strategy -- find the strongest defensible form -- is exactly the Steelman methodology applied to the script's own claims. The author internalized the right lens.

The before/after addition in Scene 3 is the most significant new content. "Before Jerry, four hours in and your agent forgets its own rules. After Jerry, every prompt re-enforces the same constraints, automatically." This is user-outcome language: it answers "so what does this do for me?" in a way the v1 stat montage did not. It transforms Scene 3 from a capabilities list into a value proposition.

The McConkey fix is elegant. "Shane McConkey -- the skier who reinvented the sport by treating every cliff as a playground" gives a non-skier enough context to receive the analogy without reducing McConkey to a biographical footnote. The descriptor does double duty: it establishes his credibility ("reinvented the sport") and his method ("treating every cliff as a playground"), which is precisely the parallel being drawn to Jerry.

**Strengthening opportunities:** Two structural gaps remain under the most charitable reading of v2's intent. First, the before/after in Scene 3 is narration-only -- the visual direction now includes a split-screen, but the emotional landing of the before/after moment would be amplified by a single text overlay that crystalizes the contrast. Second, the scene 6 close addresses human direction in narration ("directed by a human who refused to compromise") but does not complete the meta loop that iteration 1's steelman SM-001 identified as Critical. The v2 narration ends with "Come build with us" -- which is a strong CTA -- but the recursive thesis (the framework now governs the tool that built it) is still not explicitly closed in the close.

---

## Step 2: Weakness Classification

| # | Scene | Weakness | Type | Magnitude | Intended Strongest Interpretation |
|---|-------|----------|------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| 1 | Scene 6 (Close) | Close narration acknowledges human direction but does not close the meta loop: the framework now governs the tool that built it -- the most philosophically resonant fact of the whole project is still left implicit in the close | Structural | Major | Author chose clean CTA close; the loop closure is 7-8 words and does not disturb pacing |
| 2 | Scene 3 (What Jerry Is) | Before/after is strong in narration but has no corresponding text overlay; the contrast ("four hours in -- agent forgets rules" vs. "every prompt -- same constraints") deserves a visual crystallization | Structural | Major | Author correctly added before/after to narration and visual direction; the text overlay layer is the one place this contrast does not appear |
| 3 | Scene 2 (The Problem) | "Tools handle memory. Nobody had a fix for enforcement." -- the enforcement distinction is now correctly framed, but "fix for enforcement" is slightly abstract; one concrete example of what enforcement failure looks like would ground it | Evidence | Minor | Author is compressing into 15 seconds; the visual shows the degradation; narration handles the distinction with precision |
| 4 | Scene 5 (The Proof) | "More than three thousand tests. Passing." is more durable than 3,195 but narration rhythm is slightly interrupted by spelling out "More than three thousand" vs. the snappier v1 numeral delivery; production note on delivery cadence could help | Presentation | Minor | Author made the right trade (durability over snap); a delivery note restores rhythm without sacrificing the fix |
| 5 | Scene 3 (What Jerry Is) | "Thirty-three agents across seven skills" stat still lacks a comparative anchor; the before/after addition helps but the agent count specifically remains a raw number for audiences without framework context | Evidence | Minor | Author's montage approach is intentional; the before/after provides the context layer; this is a polish opportunity |
| 6 | Scene 4 (The Soul) | The "action sports footage -- big mountain skiing, cliff launches" direction is InVideo-safe but less evocative than the vintage McConkey footage; a production note acknowledging both options (generic action sports as fallback, archival McConkey if licensable) would make production execution more flexible | Structural | Minor | Author correctly simplified to avoid licensing risk; both options are valid with explicit fallback note |

**Assessment:** Zero substantive weaknesses. Zero Critical weaknesses. All six weaknesses are in presentation, structure, or evidence -- and all are minor in the context of an already strong artifact. The v2 revision correctly preserved original intent while resolving compliance and factual risks. S-003 proceeds.

## Step 3: Steelman Reconstruction

> All changes are labeled with `[SM-NNN-s003-iter2-20260218]` inline for traceability. The reconstruction preserves all original v2 content; additions are clearly marked. Original v2 text is retained exactly; only targeted improvements are inserted.

---

### SCENE 1: Cold Open (0:00-0:15)

**VISUAL:** Black screen. Single cursor blinking in a terminal. Then -- rapid-fire: Claude Code writing Python, tests passing in green cascades, git commits flying. Camera pulls back to reveal a second terminal framing the first. Code writing code. The inception moment lands.

**NARRATION:** "What happens when you give an AI a blank repo and say: build your own guardrails? Every line of code. Every test. Every quality gate. Claude Code didn't just use a framework. It wrote one."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** `CLAUDE CODE WROTE ITS OWN OVERSIGHT SYSTEM`

**MUSIC:** Low analog synth drone building tension. Dark, minimal, sub-bass pulse. 70 BPM. Think: single oscillator in a minor key, slowly adding harmonic overtones. Eerie. Anticipatory. The calm before detonation.

**TRANSITION:** Glitch cut to black. Beat drop.

---

### SCENE 2: The Problem (0:15-0:30)

**VISUAL:** Split screen -- left side shows a context window filling up like a progress bar approaching red. Right side shows AI output degrading: clean code dissolving into scrambled fragments. Text scatters and corrupts. The visual is visceral -- you can FEEL the rot.

**NARRATION:** "Here's the dirty secret of AI coding. The longer the session, the worse it gets. Context fills. Rules drift. Quality rots. Tools handle memory. Nobody had a fix for enforcement."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** `CONTEXT ROT: THE ENEMY`

**MUSIC:** Beat drops hard. Aggressive distorted bass, industrial edge. 130 BPM. Driving, relentless four-on-the-floor with crunching distortion layers. Pure adrenaline and urgency.

**TRANSITION:** Hard cut. Screen shatters.

---

### SCENE 3: What Jerry Is (0:30-1:00)

**VISUAL:** Fast-cut montage. Terminal sequences firing in rapid succession: hook validations triggering, JSON schemas loading, agents spawning. Each cut is 1-2 seconds max. Code blocks flash on screen -- constitutional constraints, quality gates, adversarial strategies. Motion graphics show the 5-layer enforcement architecture stacking up like armor plating. Then a clean split-screen before/after: left side shows degraded AI output at the 4-hour mark, right side shows consistent, clean output with enforcement active. The contrast is immediate.

**NARRATION:** "So Claude wrote Jerry. A framework that enforces its own quality. Five layers of enforcement. Constitutional governance that cannot be overridden. Thirty-three agents across seven skills. Problem-solving. Orchestration. Architecture. Structured requirements analysis and design reviews. And an adversary skill that attacks its own work before you ever see it. Before Jerry, four hours in and your agent forgets its own rules. After Jerry, every prompt re-enforces the same constraints, automatically."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** (rapid sequence, one per beat)
- `5-LAYER ENFORCEMENT`
- `33 AGENTS / 7 SKILLS`
- `CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE`
- `ADVERSARIAL SELF-REVIEW`
- `BEFORE: RULES DRIFT. AFTER: RULES HOLD.` [SM-002-s003-iter2-20260218]

**MUSIC:** Electronic anthem. Vocoder-processed vocals, driving synth arpeggios. 128 BPM, key of F minor. Each stat lands on a beat. The energy says: relentless iteration, each pass better than the last. Creator-critic-revision in musical form.

**TRANSITION:** Quick cuts accelerating to match the rhythm. Each stat lands on a downbeat. The before/after overlay lands on the final beat before transition. [SM-002-s003-iter2-20260218]

---

### SCENE 4: The Soul (1:00-1:30)

**VISUAL:** Shift in energy. Action sports footage -- big mountain skiing, cliff launches, fearless athleticism. [Note for production: If archival Shane McConkey footage is licensable, it is the preferred choice. Generic big-mountain skiing is the licensed fallback. Either works -- the analogy is in the narration, not the specific athlete.] [SM-006-s003-iter2-20260218] Splitscreen with terminal output showing adversarial reviews running. The contrast is the point: dead-serious engineering wrapped in a personality that refuses to be boring. Cut to: code comments with actual humor in them. A quality score hitting 0.93 with celebratory ASCII art. An agent named "Saucer Boy."

**NARRATION:** "But here's the thing. Shane McConkey -- the skier who reinvented the sport by treating every cliff as a playground -- didn't change skiing by being serious. He did it by being the best in the world and grinning the entire time. Jerry works the same way. Ten adversarial strategies. Red team. Devil's advocate. Steelman. Pre-mortem. It tears its own work apart. And it has personality while it does it. Because if you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** `IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING FUN, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG`

**MUSIC:** Smooth transition to lo-fi boom-bap piano loop. 85 BPM, jazzy minor-key chords. Confident, unhurried swagger. Head-nod groove with vinyl crackle texture. The energy shifts from hype to quiet dominance.

**TRANSITION:** Smooth crossfade. Energy shifts from hype to confident swagger.

---

### SCENE 5: The Proof (1:30-1:50)

**VISUAL:** Numbers flying onto screen like a scoreboard. Each stat slams into place with kinetic weight. Terminal running full test suite -- green checkmarks cascading. Quality score calculating in real-time: dimension by dimension, the weighted composite climbing to 0.92... 0.93... 0.94. The quality gate PASSES. Burst of green terminal output.

**NARRATION:** "More than three thousand tests. Passing. [Note for VO talent: deliver "More than three thousand" with the same punching cadence as a numeral -- not as a measured phrase. The rhythm is: beat-beat-beat-PASSING.] [SM-004-s003-iter2-20260218] A quality gate at zero-point-nine-two that does not bend. Ten adversarial strategies that run before any deliverable ships. This isn't a demo. This is production-grade code."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** (stacking, each hitting like a punch)
- `3,000+ TESTS PASSING`
- `QUALITY GATE >= 0.92`
- `10 ADVERSARIAL STRATEGIES`
- `PRODUCTION-GRADE CODE`

**MUSIC:** Minimalist, hard-hitting trap beat. 140 BPM half-time feel. Sparse -- just kick, snare, and a single menacing synth line. Nothing but the numbers. The beat is pure confidence. No filler. No decoration. Just facts.

**TRANSITION:** Hard cut to black. One beat of silence.

---

### SCENE 6: Close (1:50-2:00)

**VISUAL:** Clean. The Jerry logo materializes from scattered code fragments assembling themselves -- the same way the framework was built, piece by piece, written by Claude Code. Below it: the GitHub URL. The Apache 2.0 badge. A terminal cursor blinks, waiting. Ready for the next builder.

**NARRATION:** "Jerry. Open source. Apache 2.0. Every line written by Claude Code, directed by a human who refused to compromise. The framework that governs the tool that built it. Come build with us." [SM-001-s003-iter2-20260218]

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
- `JERRY FRAMEWORK`
- `APACHE 2.0 / OPEN SOURCE`
- `github.com/geekatron/jerry`

**MUSIC:** Final chord -- the anthem synth resolving to a single sustained note. Clean. Triumphant. Done.

**TRANSITION:** Fade to black. Logo holds for 3 seconds.

---

## Step 4: Best Case Scenario

### Ideal Conditions for Maximum Impact

The v2 script achieves maximum impact when three conditions hold:

1. **Compliance infrastructure is confirmed.** V2 eliminates all named commercial tracks, replacing them with mood/style descriptions. The script is production-music-library-ready. Maximum impact is realized when the production team sources cues that genuinely match the descriptions -- particularly the 70 BPM analog drone for Scene 1 (tension without aggression), the 130 BPM industrial bass for Scene 2 (urgency and adrenaline), and the 85 BPM lo-fi piano for Scene 4 (swagger without strain). The musical arc is as load-bearing as the narration arc; generic library music that misses the mood descriptions degrades the emotional pacing.

2. **The before/after in Scene 3 lands as user outcome, not technical description.** "Four hours in and your agent forgets its own rules" is not a technical claim -- it is an experience claim. It lands hardest with audience members who have personally experienced context rot in long Claude Code sessions. At a Claude Code birthday party at Shack15, this is near-universal. The v2 script correctly puts this in the narration rather than a text overlay; the before/after split-screen visual reinforces it without reducing it to a stat. The full impact requires the visual production to execute the split-screen cleanly at the Scene 3 before/after beat.

3. **The close's meta loop closure resonates.** With SM-001 incorporated, Scene 6 closes with "The framework that governs the tool that built it." This is the recursive thesis in its most compact form. It lands strongest for an audience that has been tracking the meta angle since Scene 1 -- and for the specific Anthropic audience at this event, the governance and constitutional AI implications are not lost. The close transforms from a product endcard into a philosophical statement, which is the correct register for an Anthropic audience.

### Key Assumptions

| Assumption | Confidence | Rationale |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| Production music library has cues matching the mood/BPM/key descriptions | HIGH | Epidemic Sound and Artlist between them have tens of thousands of cues; the descriptions are specific enough to find matches |
| Audience at Shack15 has experienced context rot in long AI coding sessions | VERY HIGH | Claude Code birthday party audience is precisely the developer population with this experience |
| "More than three thousand" reads as a strong stat without the specific numeral | HIGH | The rounded form is no less impressive; "more than three thousand" is actually more dramatic than "3,195" for a general audience |
| McConkey inline descriptor gives sufficient context for non-skiers | HIGH | "The skier who reinvented the sport by treating every cliff as a playground" establishes both credibility and method in one phrase |
| The meta loop closure ("framework that governs the tool that built it") adds rather than overstates | HIGH | The claim is literally true and directly supported by the framework's documented behavior |

### Confidence Assessment

A rational evaluator should have **VERY HIGH confidence** in the v2 script's effectiveness. The Critical and Major findings from iteration 1 have been resolved without sacrificing the script's creative energy. The emotional arc is intact. The claims are defensible. The Saucer Boy persona is consistent. The v2 script with the two Major improvements from this steelman is the strongest achievable version of the original intent.

## Step 5: Improvement Findings Table

| ID | Description | Severity | Location | Original (v2) | Strengthened | Dimension |
|----|-------------|----------|----------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| SM-001-s003-iter2-20260218 | Scene 6 close adds meta loop closure: "The framework that governs the tool that built it" -- closes the recursive thesis opened in Scene 1 | Major | Scene 6 Narration | "Every line written by Claude Code, directed by a human who refused to compromise. Come build with us." | "Every line written by Claude Code, directed by a human who refused to compromise. The framework that governs the tool that built it. Come build with us." | Internal Consistency |
| SM-002-s003-iter2-20260218 | Scene 3 before/after contrast gets a crystallizing text overlay on the final beat: "BEFORE: RULES DRIFT. AFTER: RULES HOLD." | Major | Scene 3 Text Overlays | 4 overlays: 5-LAYER ENFORCEMENT, 33 AGENTS / 7 SKILLS, CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE, ADVERSARIAL SELF-REVIEW | Add 5th overlay timed to the before/after narration beat: `BEFORE: RULES DRIFT. AFTER: RULES HOLD.` | Completeness |
| SM-003-s003-iter2-20260218 | Scene 2 narration: add one concrete anchor for "enforcement failure" -- "Rules set at session start are overridden by context fill" | Minor | Scene 2 Narration | "Tools handle memory. Nobody had a fix for enforcement." | "Tools handle memory. Nobody had a fix for enforcement -- rules set at session start, erased by context fill." | Evidence Quality |
| SM-004-s003-iter2-20260218 | Scene 5 VO delivery note: "More than three thousand" needs punching cadence guidance to match numeral rhythm | Minor | Scene 5 Narration (production note) | No delivery note | Add: `[Note for VO talent: deliver "More than three thousand" with punching cadence -- beat-beat-beat-PASSING]` | Actionability |
| SM-005-s003-iter2-20260218 | Scene 3 stat: "Thirty-three agents" could add brief qualifier "each purpose-built" to anchor the raw number | Minor | Scene 3 Narration | "Thirty-three agents across seven skills." | "Thirty-three agents across seven skills, each purpose-built." | Evidence Quality |
| SM-006-s003-iter2-20260218 | Scene 4 visual: add production fallback note for McConkey footage (archival preferred if licensable, generic action sports as licensed fallback) | Minor | Scene 4 Visual Direction | "Action sports footage -- big mountain skiing, cliff launches, fearless athleticism" | Add: `[Note for production: If archival Shane McConkey footage is licensable, it is the preferred choice. Generic big-mountain skiing is the licensed fallback.]` | Actionability |

---

## Step 6: Improvement Details

### SM-001-s003-iter2-20260218 (Major) -- Scene 6 Meta Loop Closure

**Affected Dimension:** Internal Consistency

**Original Content (Scene 6 Narration, v2):**
> "Jerry. Open source. Apache 2.0. Every line written by Claude Code, directed by a human who refused to compromise. Come build with us."

**Strengthened Content:**
> "Jerry. Open source. Apache 2.0. Every line written by Claude Code, directed by a human who refused to compromise. The framework that governs the tool that built it. Come build with us."

**Rationale:** Scene 1 opens with "Claude Code didn't just use a framework. It wrote one." The meta thesis is: Claude Code wrote its own guardrails. The philosophically compelling completion of that thesis is not just that Claude Code wrote the framework -- it is that the framework now governs Claude Code. V2 resolved the attribution overclaim (replacing "built entirely" with "wrote" and adding human direction) but did not add the recursive closure. The iteration 1 steelman identified this as Critical (SM-001-s003-20260218); in v2 the close is now more carefully worded so the gap is Major rather than Critical. "The framework that governs the tool that built it" is 9 words. It does not break the pacing of the close (the close is already sparse). It creates the structural bookend that Scene 1 opens and Scene 6 can close. Without it, the close says "Claude Code built this thing, come use it." With it, the close says "Claude Code built this thing, and now operates under it. Come use it." The second version is categorically more interesting for an Anthropic alignment-aware audience.

**Best Case Conditions:** Strongest when the audience has been following the meta angle since Scene 1. At an Anthropic birthday event for Claude Code, this is the expected audience state.

---

### SM-002-s003-iter2-20260218 (Major) -- Scene 3 Before/After Text Overlay

**Affected Dimension:** Completeness

**Original Content (Scene 3 Text Overlays, v2):**
> Four overlays: 5-LAYER ENFORCEMENT | 33 AGENTS / 7 SKILLS | CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE | ADVERSARIAL SELF-REVIEW

**Strengthened Content:**
> Add fifth overlay: `BEFORE: RULES DRIFT. AFTER: RULES HOLD.`

**Rationale:** V2 made a genuine improvement by adding the before/after user-outcome to the narration and visual direction of Scene 3. The addition is the most impactful new content in the entire revision -- it transforms Scene 3 from a capabilities list into a value proposition. However, the text overlay layer -- which is the highest-contrast, highest-retention medium in a video -- does not reflect this improvement. The four existing overlays are all framework capabilities (layers, agents, governance, self-review). None capture the user outcome. Adding a fifth overlay "BEFORE: RULES DRIFT. AFTER: RULES HOLD." serves three functions: (1) it captures the most important before/after contrast in its punchiest form, (2) it ensures the value proposition lands even for viewers whose attention drifts from narration, (3) it creates a visual rhythm break after four stat overlays (the fifth overlay is structurally different -- a before/after contrast rather than a capability label). The overlay timing should align with the before/after sentence in the narration ("Before Jerry...After Jerry...").

**Best Case Conditions:** The production executes the before/after overlay with sufficient screen time to read (minimum 1.5 seconds), distinct visual treatment from the capability overlays (e.g., split coloring, animation differential), and tight timing to the narration beat.

---

## Scoring Impact

| Dimension | Weight | Impact | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Completeness | 0.20 | Positive | SM-002 fills the gap in Scene 3 text overlay layer -- the most important new v2 addition (before/after user outcome) is now represented in all three mediums: narration, visual, and text overlay |
| Internal Consistency | 0.20 | Positive | SM-001 closes the recursive meta thesis loop: Scene 1 opens "Claude Code wrote its own guardrails," Scene 6 now explicitly closes "the framework now governs the tool that built it" -- structural arc is complete |
| Methodological Rigor | 0.20 | Neutral | V2 already demonstrates methodological rigor in its revision approach -- all P0/P1 findings resolved without overcorrection. No structural gaps remain after SM-001 and SM-002 |
| Evidence Quality | 0.15 | Positive | SM-003 adds one concrete anchor for "enforcement failure" in Scene 2; SM-005 adds brief qualifier to agent count stat -- both minor but directionally positive |
| Actionability | 0.15 | Positive | SM-004 and SM-006 add production-facing delivery and sourcing notes that eliminate director interpretation variance in the two most execution-sensitive moments (VO delivery cadence; archival footage sourcing) |
| Traceability | 0.10 | Positive | All 6 improvements carry SM-NNN-s003-iter2-20260218 identifiers; each is linked to a dimension; inline annotations throughout reconstruction; iteration delta is explicitly documented |

**Net Impact:** All six dimensions are neutral-to-positive. No new weaknesses introduced. The reconstruction is a strict improvement over the v2 baseline.

---

## Iteration Delta Assessment

### What V2 Fixed (Confirmed Resolved)

| Finding (Iter 1) | Priority | V2 Resolution | Assessment |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|------------|
| Music Licensing (SM-003 equivalents in v1) | P0 | All 5 commercial tracks replaced with BPM/key/mood descriptions + production library sourcing note in Script Overview | Fully resolved. No licensable content named anywhere in v2. |
| Attribution Overclaim | P0 | "wrote" throughout; Scene 6 adds "directed by a human who refused to compromise" | Fully resolved. Human direction explicitly acknowledged. |
| Test Count Stale | P0 | "More than three thousand" in narration; "3,000+" in text overlay | Fully resolved. Rounded form is more durable and no less impressive. |
| Audience Comprehension Gap | P0 | Before/after user outcome added to Scene 3 narration and visual direction | Fully resolved. "Before Jerry...After Jerry..." transforms Scene 3 from capabilities list to value proposition. |
| Competitor Erasure | P1 | Enforcement-specific framing: "Tools handle memory. Nobody had a fix for enforcement." | Fully resolved. Framing is accurate and does not erase competitor memory management capabilities. |
| NASA-grade Unsubstantiated | P1 | "Structured requirements analysis and design reviews" -- functional description | Fully resolved. No unsubstantiated standard citation. |
| McConkey Reference Niche | P1 | Inline descriptor: "the skier who reinvented the sport by treating every cliff as a playground" | Fully resolved. Non-skiers have sufficient context. |
| "This Is Production" Defensibility | P1 | "production-grade code" in narration and text overlay | Fully resolved. Describes quality standard rather than deployment claim. |
| InVideo Capability Assumptions | P1 | Simplified: removed "nested terminal inception," "hexagonal architecture assembling itself," "vintage ski footage" specificity | Fully resolved. Visual directions now achievable with InVideo AI and generic stock footage. |

### What Remains as New Findings in V2

| Finding | Magnitude | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| SM-001: Meta loop closure in Scene 6 | Major | Identified as Critical in iter 1; v2's improved close (human direction) partially addresses it but does not close the recursive governance loop |
| SM-002: Before/after text overlay in Scene 3 | Major | New finding specific to v2 -- the before/after addition was not in v1, so this is a new opportunity created by the v2 improvement itself |
| SM-003: Enforcement failure concrete anchor | Minor | Scene 2 is tighter in v2 but still slightly abstract on "enforcement" |
| SM-004: VO delivery note for "More than three thousand" | Minor | New finding specific to v2's rounded form -- the numeral version did not need this note |
| SM-005: Agent count qualifier | Minor | Iteration 1 SM-002 identified this; v2 did not incorporate it |
| SM-006: McConkey footage fallback note | Minor | Iteration 1 identified the McConkey sourcing risk; v2's simplified direction is better but a fallback note improves production flexibility |

### Genuine New Strengths in V2

V2 introduces three new strengths not present in v1 that warrant explicit documentation for downstream critique strategies:

1. **Music arc is now fully specified and original.** The BPM/key/mood descriptions give the production team a complete musical brief without any copyright exposure. The arc (70 BPM drone -> 130 BPM industrial -> 128 BPM F-minor anthem -> 85 BPM lo-fi -> 140 BPM trap -> sustained anthem chord) is emotionally coherent and maps precisely to the scene emotional arc. This is a production-design strength, not just a compliance fix.

2. **Before/after user outcome in Scene 3 is the best new content in the script.** "Before Jerry, four hours in and your agent forgets its own rules. After Jerry, every prompt re-enforces the same constraints, automatically." This is the clearest value-proposition statement in the entire script. It answers the audience question "so what does this do for me?" that the stat montage alone cannot. It belongs in Scene 3 and the v2 revision correctly places it there.

3. **Scene 6 human direction acknowledgment is more compelling than the original.** "Every line written by Claude Code, directed by a human who refused to compromise." This is not only more accurate than "built entirely by Claude Code" -- it is more interesting. The phrase "refused to compromise" encodes a character claim about the human author that adds to the Saucer Boy narrative. The original overclaim was weaker, not just less defensible.
