## Script Overview

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total Runtime | 2:00 |
| Narration Word Count | 257 words |
| Target WPM | 140 |
| Effective Runtime at 140 WPM | ~1:50 |
| Buffer for Transitions/Pauses | ~10 seconds |
| Tone | Saucer Boy -- technically brilliant, wildly fun |
| Music Arc | Tension build -> hype escalation -> anthem peak -> swagger -> confidence -> triumphant close |
| Music Sourcing | All cues are mood/style descriptions for production music library selection (Epidemic Sound, Artlist, or equivalent). All 6 music cues must be previewed and approved by a human reviewer before final render. Scene 2 drop, Scene 3 anthem escalation, and Scene 4 lo-fi pivot require specific confirmation. |

---

## SCENE 1: Cold Open (0:00-0:15)

**VISUAL:** Black screen. Single cursor blinking in a terminal. Then -- rapid-fire: Claude Code writing Python, tests passing in green cascades, git commits flying. Camera pulls back to reveal a second terminal framing the first. Code writing code. The inception moment lands.

**NARRATION:** "What happens when a developer gives Claude Code a blank repo and says: write your own guardrails? Every line of code. Every test. Every quality gate. Claude Code didn't just use a framework. It wrote one."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** `CLAUDE CODE WROTE ITS OWN GUARDRAILS`

**MUSIC:** Low analog synth drone building tension. Dark, minimal, sub-bass pulse. 70 BPM. Think: single oscillator in a minor key, slowly adding harmonic overtones. Eerie. Anticipatory. The calm before detonation.

**TRANSITION:** Glitch cut to black. Beat drop.

---

## SCENE 2: The Problem (0:15-0:30)

**VISUAL:** Split screen -- left side shows a context window filling up like a progress bar approaching red. Right side shows AI output degrading: clean code dissolving into scrambled fragments. Text scatters and corrupts. The visual is visceral -- you can FEEL the rot.

**FALLBACK:** Before/after static frames -- left side clean code on dark background, right side red-tinted scrambled output with visible artifacts. No animation required.

**NARRATION:** "Here's the dirty secret of AI coding. The longer the session, the worse it gets. Context fills. Rules drift. Quality rots. Tools handle memory. Nobody had a fix for enforcement."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** `CONTEXT ROT: THE ENEMY`

**MUSIC:** Beat drops hard. Aggressive distorted bass, industrial edge. 130 BPM. Driving, relentless four-on-the-floor with crunching distortion layers. Pure adrenaline and urgency.

**TRANSITION:** Hard cut. Screen shatters.

---

## SCENE 3: What Jerry Is (0:30-1:00)

**VISUAL:** Fast-cut montage. Terminal sequences firing in rapid succession: hook validations triggering, JSON schemas loading, agents spawning. Each cut is 1-2 seconds max. Code blocks flash on screen -- constitutional constraints, quality gates, adversarial strategies. Motion graphics show the 5-layer enforcement architecture stacking up like armor plating. Then a clean split-screen before/after: left side shows degraded AI output after extended use, right side shows consistent, clean output with enforcement active. The contrast is immediate.

**NARRATION:** "A framework that enforces its own quality. Five layers of enforcement. Constitutional governance with hard constraints enforced at every prompt. More than thirty agents across seven skills. And an adversary skill that attacks its own work before you ever see it. Before Jerry, after extended sessions your agent forgets its own rules. After Jerry: hour twelve works like hour one. The rules never drift."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** (rapid sequence, one per beat)
- `5-LAYER ENFORCEMENT`
- `30+ AGENTS / 7 SKILLS`
- `CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE`
- `ADVERSARIAL SELF-REVIEW`

**MUSIC:** Electronic anthem. Vocoder-processed vocals, driving synth arpeggios. 128 BPM, key of F minor. Each stat lands on a beat. The energy says: relentless iteration, each pass better than the last. Creator-critic-revision in musical form.

**TRANSITION:** Quick cuts accelerating to match the rhythm. Each stat lands on a downbeat.

---

## SCENE 4: The Soul (1:00-1:30)

**VISUAL:** Shift in energy. Action sports footage -- big mountain skiing, cliff launches, fearless athleticism. Splitscreen with terminal output showing adversarial reviews running. The contrast is the point: dead-serious engineering wrapped in a personality that refuses to be boring. Cut to: code comments with actual humor in them. A quality score hitting 0.93 with celebratory ASCII art. An agent named "Saucer Boy."

**NARRATION:** "But here's the thing. Shane McConkey didn't reinvent skiing by being serious. He did it by being the best in the world and grinning the entire time. Jerry works the same way. Ten adversarial strategies. Red team. Devil's advocate. Steelman. Pre-mortem. It tears its own work apart -- and has personality doing it. Because if you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong."

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
- `SHANE McCONKEY // REINVENTED SKIING BY REFUSING TO BE BORING`
- `IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING FUN, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG`

**MUSIC:** Smooth transition to lo-fi boom-bap piano loop. 85 BPM, jazzy minor-key chords. Confident, unhurried swagger. Head-nod groove with vinyl crackle texture. The energy shifts from hype to quiet dominance.

**TRANSITION:** Smooth crossfade. Energy shifts from hype to confident swagger.

---

## SCENE 5: The Proof (1:30-1:50)

**VISUAL:** Numbers flying onto screen like a scoreboard. Each stat slams into place with kinetic weight. Terminal running full test suite -- green checkmarks cascading. Tournament bracket visualization: 10 adversarial strategies converging on a single quality gate. The gate holds. Burst of green terminal output.

**FALLBACK:** Static scoreboard text overlays slam in sequentially with impact frames. Omit live counter animation. Each stat appears on a clean dark background with bold typography.

**NARRATION:** "More than three thousand tests. Passing. A quality gate at zero-point-nine-two that does not bend. Ten adversarial strategies running before anything ships. This isn't a demo. This is production-grade code."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** (stacking, each hitting like a punch)
- `3,000+ TESTS PASSING`
- `10 ADVERSARIAL STRATEGIES`
- `0.92 QUALITY GATE`
- `PRODUCTION-GRADE CODE`

**LOWER-THIRD** (persistent from 1:30 onward): `github.com/geekatron/jerry`

**MUSIC:** Minimalist, hard-hitting trap beat. 140 BPM half-time feel. Sparse -- just kick, snare, and a single menacing synth line. Nothing but the numbers. The beat is pure confidence. No filler. No decoration. Just facts.

**TRANSITION:** Hard cut to black. One beat of silence.

---

## SCENE 6: Close (1:50-2:00)

**VISUAL:** Clean. The Jerry logo materializes from scattered code fragments assembling themselves -- the same way the framework was built, piece by piece, written by Claude Code. Below it: the GitHub URL. The Apache 2.0 badge. A QR code linking to github.com/geekatron/jerry, displayed alongside the URL for a minimum of 13 seconds (10-second hold + 3-second logo hold). A terminal cursor blinks, waiting. Ready for the next builder.

**FALLBACK:** Slow zoom on Jerry text logo over dark code-fragment background. GitHub URL, Apache badge, and QR code fade in. Terminal cursor blinks. No particle animation required.

**NARRATION:** "Jerry. Open source. Apache 2.0. Every line written by Claude Code, directed by a human who refused to compromise. The framework that governs the tool that built it. Come build with us."

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
- `JERRY FRAMEWORK`
- `APACHE 2.0 / OPEN SOURCE`
- `github.com/geekatron/jerry`
- QR code (linking to github.com/geekatron/jerry)

**MUSIC:** Final chord -- the anthem synth resolving to a single sustained note. Clean. Triumphant. Done.

**TRANSITION:** Fade to black. Logo and QR code hold for 3 seconds.

### Finding-Level Traceability

| # | Finding | Priority | Status | How Addressed |
|---|---------|----------|--------|---------------|
| CF-001 | "OVERSIGHT SYSTEM" overlay AI safety vocabulary | Critical | FIXED | Changed text overlay from `CLAUDE CODE WROTE ITS OWN OVERSIGHT SYSTEM` to `CLAUDE CODE WROTE ITS OWN GUARDRAILS`. "Guardrails" is Anthropic-native vocabulary, developer-accessible, and carries no AI safety governance connotation. Narration already used "guardrails" (unchanged). |
| CF-002 | Runtime overrun -- 278 words at natural delivery pace | Critical | FIXED | Trimmed from 278 to 257 words (-21 words). At 140 WPM: ~1:50 effective, leaving ~10 seconds for transitions, pauses, and breath. At natural delivery pace (120-130 WPM): 1:58-2:08 -- the lower bound fits comfortably. Primary cuts: Scene 3 (-8 words via skill list compression and "So Claude wrote Jerry" removal), Scene 4 (-16 words via McConkey grounding moved to text overlay). Timed table read at natural pace recommended before lock (see Production Dependencies). |
| CF-003 | Before/after uses mechanism language | Critical | FIXED | Replaced "every prompt re-enforces the same constraints, automatically" with "hour twelve works like hour one. The rules never drift." Outcome language: the audience feels what Jerry prevents (drift) rather than how it works (re-enforcement). |
| CF-004 | "Cannot be overridden" factually inaccurate governance scope | Critical | FIXED | Replaced "Constitutional governance that cannot be overridden" with "Constitutional governance with hard constraints enforced at every prompt." Scopes the non-override claim to HARD tier only, matching quality-enforcement.md Tier Vocabulary exactly. |
| CF-005 | "33 agents" unhedged and enumerable | Critical | FIXED | Narration changed to "More than thirty agents across seven skills." Text overlay changed to `30+ AGENTS / 7 SKILLS`. Floor formulation survives agent count changes between Feb 18 and Feb 21, and post-OSS publication growth. |
| CF-006 | GitHub URL unconfirmed; no QR code | Critical | FIXED | QR code added to Scene 6 visual direction and text overlay, visible for 13+ seconds. GitHub URL added as lower-third persistent from Scene 5 (1:30 onward) for 30 seconds of total visibility. Production note added to script header requiring HTTP 200 confirmation by Feb 20 23:59 with fallback text specified. |
| CF-007 | InVideo visual fallbacks absent | Critical | FIXED | FALLBACK lines added to Scene 2 (static before/after frames), Scene 5 (static scoreboard with impact frames), and Scene 6 (slow zoom on text logo, no particle animation). InVideo test pass gate added to Production Dependencies (Feb 19). |
| MF-001 | Attribution asymmetry -- human direction arrives 110s late | Major | FIXED | Scene 1 narration now opens with "What happens when a developer gives Claude Code..." Human agency established in second 1 of the video, not second 110. |
| MF-002 | McConkey auditory-only (no text overlay) | Major | FIXED | Added Scene 4 text overlay: `SHANE McCONKEY // REINVENTED SKIING BY REFUSING TO BE BORING`. At a live event with ambient noise, the text overlay ensures the reference lands even if narration is partially missed. |
| MF-003 | Scene 6 meta loop not closed | Major | FIXED | Added "The framework that governs the tool that built it." to Scene 6 narration between "refused to compromise" and "Come build with us." The recursive thesis is now explicit: Jerry governs Claude Code, Claude Code wrote Jerry. |
| MF-004 | Production dependency checklist absent | Major | FIXED | Production Dependencies section added at end of script with 4 items: GitHub URL confirmation, agent count verification, InVideo test pass gate (Feb 19), Plan B decision point (Feb 20 noon). |
| MF-005 | Scene 5 self-grading optics | Major | FIXED | Quality gate visual reframed as adversarial tournament bracket: "10 adversarial strategies converging on a single quality gate." Text overlays reordered to lead with adversarial strategies before the score. Narration emphasizes strategies running "before anything ships" rather than a score climbing in real-time. |
| MF-006 | "Four hours" unverified empirical claim | Major | FIXED | Changed "four hours in" to "after extended sessions" -- colloquial, defensible, no false precision. Combined with CF-003 fix in Scene 3. |
| MF-007 | Attribution asymmetry (Scene 1 vs. Scene 6) | Major | FIXED | Resolved by MF-001 fix -- "a developer" in Scene 1 establishes human agency from the start, matching Scene 6's "directed by a human." Both poles of the collaboration are present in both bookend scenes. |

## Production Dependencies

> Go/no-go checklist for production team. All items must be resolved before final render.

| # | Dependency | Owner | Deadline | Fallback |
|---|-----------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1 | **GitHub URL confirmation.** `github.com/geekatron/jerry` must return HTTP 200, public (no auth), README present, LICENSE: Apache 2.0. | Repo owner | Feb 20, 23:59 | Replace Scene 6 overlay with "Open Source Launch: February 21, 2026." Update narration: remove "Open source." |
| 2 | **Agent count verification.** Run `find . -name "*.md" -path "*/agents/*" \| wc -l` on the Feb 20 commit. Confirm count >= 30. | Developer | Feb 20, 18:00 | If count < 30, change narration to "dozens of agents" and overlay to `AGENTS / 7 SKILLS`. |
| 3 | **InVideo test pass gate.** All 6 scenes must render as intended in InVideo AI. If any scene fails, activate FALLBACK visual directions. Scenes 2, 5, and 6 are highest risk. | Video producer | Feb 19, noon | Activate FALLBACK directions for failed scenes. Pre-render screen recording of actual Jerry quality gate calculation as Scene 5 asset. |
| 4 | **Plan B decision point.** If InVideo output is unsatisfactory after Feb 19 test pass, switch to Plan B: screen-recorded terminal walkthrough with voiceover, same narration script. | Project lead | Feb 20, noon | Plan B uses same narration, same music cues, but replaces AI-generated video with screen recordings of actual Jerry execution. |
