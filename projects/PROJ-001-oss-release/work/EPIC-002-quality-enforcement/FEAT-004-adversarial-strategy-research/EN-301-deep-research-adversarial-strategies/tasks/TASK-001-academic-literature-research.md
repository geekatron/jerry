## Description

Systematic research of adversarial review strategies from academic and formal sources: structured analytic techniques (Heuer & Pherson), argumentation theory (Toulmin, Walton), decision science (Klein pre-mortem), cybersecurity red teaming (NIST, MITRE), and AI safety (Constitutional AI, AI Safety via Debate).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] At least 8 strategies identified from peer-reviewed or formally published sources (12 identified)
- [x] Each strategy has: name, origin/author, citation (DOI/ISBN), description, mechanism, strengths, weaknesses
- [x] Sources span argumentation theory, intelligence analysis, cybersecurity, and AI safety
- [x] L0/L1/L2 output levels present
- [x] Research artifact persisted to filesystem (P-002)
