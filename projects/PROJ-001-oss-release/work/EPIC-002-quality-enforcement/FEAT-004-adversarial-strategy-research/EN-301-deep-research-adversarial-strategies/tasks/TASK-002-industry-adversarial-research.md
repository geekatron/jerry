## Description

Research adversarial review strategies from industry software engineering practice, design review methodology, LLM/AI-specific research, and quality assurance traditions. Focus areas: Fagan Inspection, Google Code Review, ATAM, Pair Programming, Design Critique, Constitutional AI, Self-Refine, Multi-Agent Debate, Chain-of-Verification, CRITIC, Reflexion, LLM-as-Judge, Mutation Testing, and Exploratory Testing Heuristics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] At least 8 strategies identified from industry and LLM-specific sources
- [x] Each strategy has: name, origin/author, citation (DOI/ISBN), description, mechanism, strengths, weaknesses
- [x] Sources span software engineering, design review, LLM/AI-specific, and QA
- [x] L0/L1/L2 output levels present
- [x] Research artifact persisted to filesystem (P-002)
