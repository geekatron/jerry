## Description

Research adversarial review strategies from industry practice and LLM/AI-specific sources: software engineering review patterns (Fagan, IEEE 1028), design critique methodologies, LLM-specific patterns (Self-Refine, Chain-of-Verification, CRITIC framework, Reflexion, Multi-agent Debate), and QA adversarial patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least 8 strategies identified from industry and LLM sources
- [ ] Each strategy has: name, origin/author, citation, description, mechanism, strengths, weaknesses
- [ ] LLM-specific patterns (Self-Refine, CoV, CRITIC, Reflexion) covered with paper citations
- [ ] L0/L1/L2 output levels present
- [ ] Research artifact persisted to filesystem (P-002)
