## Description

Research adversarial review strategies from industry practice and LLM/AI-specific sources: software engineering review patterns (Fagan, IEEE 1028), design critique methodologies, LLM-specific patterns (Self-Refine, Chain-of-Verification, CRITIC framework, Reflexion, Multi-agent Debate), and QA adversarial patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] At least 8 strategies identified from industry and LLM sources (14 identified across 4 domains)
- [x] Each strategy has: name, origin/author, citation, description, mechanism, strengths, weaknesses
- [x] LLM-specific patterns (Self-Refine, CoV, CRITIC, Reflexion) covered with paper citations
- [x] L0/L1/L2 output levels present
- [x] Research artifact persisted to filesystem (P-002)
