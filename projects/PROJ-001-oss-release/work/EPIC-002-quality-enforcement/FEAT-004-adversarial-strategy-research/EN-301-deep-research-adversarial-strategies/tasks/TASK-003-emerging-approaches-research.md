## Content

### Description

Exploratory research into emerging, alternative, and less mainstream adversarial review approaches: cross-domain transfer strategies (legal, medical, military), cognitive science debiasing techniques, systems thinking adversarial patterns, and novel AI/ML adversarial techniques (2024-2026). This is the third of three parallel research tasks feeding into the EN-301 synthesis.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] At least 5 novel/emerging strategies identified not commonly in mainstream literature (10 identified)
- [x] Cross-domain transfer approaches explored (legal, medical, military, journalism)
- [x] Each strategy has: name, origin, citation, description, mechanism, novelty factor, LLM applicability
- [x] L0/L1/L2 output levels present
- [x] Research artifact persisted to filesystem (P-002)

### Implementation Notes

Third of three parallel research tasks (with TASK-001 and TASK-002). Feeds into TASK-004 synthesis. Uses nse-explorer agent for broader exploration scope. 10 emerging strategies cataloged (E1-E10) covering cross-domain transfer, cognitive debiasing, AI-native patterns, and novel meta-strategies.
