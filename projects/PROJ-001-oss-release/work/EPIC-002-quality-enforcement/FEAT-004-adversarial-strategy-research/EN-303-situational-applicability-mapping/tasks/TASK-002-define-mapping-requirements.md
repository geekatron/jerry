## Content

### Description

Define formal requirements for what the situational mapping must cover, ensuring completeness and traceability back to FEAT-004 objectives. Requirements should specify what each applicability profile must contain, what the decision tree must handle, and what validation criteria apply.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Requirements document covers all aspects of situational mapping deliverables
- [ ] Requirements are traceable to FEAT-004 acceptance criteria
- [ ] Each requirement is testable and verifiable
- [ ] Requirements specify mandatory fields for applicability profiles
- [ ] Requirements define decision tree completeness criteria

### Implementation Notes

Second of two parallel inputs to TASK-003 (mapping). Can run in parallel with TASK-001 (taxonomy). Uses nse-requirements agent for NASA SE requirements methodology.
