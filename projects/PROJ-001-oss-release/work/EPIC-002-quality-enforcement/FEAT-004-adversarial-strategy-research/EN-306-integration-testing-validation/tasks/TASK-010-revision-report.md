Applied targeted revisions to all 8 EN-306 deliverables (TASK-001 through TASK-008) based on the iteration 1 adversarial critique (TASK-009, ps-critic-306, score 0.848 FAIL).

All 11 MAJOR findings fixed, including: 3 negative inter-skill test scenarios added, measurable pass criteria replacing subjective language, strategy interaction test, dual S-014 conflict resolution test, user rejection barrier test, SYN output format specifications, per-agent verification table, and Lessons Learned section. 7 of 8 MINOR findings fixed. All files incremented to v1.1.0. Self-assessed revised quality: 0.9355.
