## Summary

Performed iteration 2 adversarial critique of EN-306 (Integration Testing & Validation) revised deliverables (TASK-001 through TASK-008, v1.1.0). Verified all 26 findings from iteration 1 critique (TASK-009): 25 FIXED, 1 ACKNOWLEDGED. Identified 3 new findings (2 MINOR, 1 OBSERVATION). Scored all 8 deliverables using the 6-dimension canonical rubric with unequal weights. 6 of 8 deliverables scored above the 0.92 threshold individually; 2 (TASK-005 and TASK-006) scored below due to structural constraints (theoretical platform assessment and self-audit limitations). Aggregate score meets threshold.
