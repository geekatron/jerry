## Description

Survey of industry LLM guardrail frameworks: Guardrails AI, NeMo Guardrails, LangChain guardrails, Guidance (Microsoft), Outlines, LMQL, and other relevant frameworks. For each: architecture, enforcement mechanisms, integration patterns, strengths, weaknesses, and applicability to Claude Code's context. Include authoritative citations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] At least 5 guardrail frameworks surveyed (9 surveyed)
- [x] Each framework: architecture overview, enforcement mechanisms, integration patterns
- [x] Strengths and weaknesses documented with evidence
- [x] Applicability to Claude Code assessed for each framework
- [x] Patterns and anti-patterns extracted for Jerry's use (6 patterns)
- [x] L0/L1/L2 output levels present
- [x] Research artifact persisted to filesystem (P-002)
