## Description

Research the .claude/rules/ enforcement mechanism in Claude Code. Document how rules are loaded, when they take effect, their scope and persistence, effectiveness at enforcing coding standards, and known limitations. Analyze Jerry's existing rules (.claude/rules/*.md) for effectiveness patterns. Include authoritative citations from Claude Code documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] .claude/rules/ loading mechanism documented (when, how, scope)
- [ ] Effectiveness assessment: what rules can/cannot enforce
- [ ] Analysis of Jerry's existing rules for pattern effectiveness
- [ ] Comparison with other LLM instruction mechanisms
- [ ] Best practices for rule authoring documented
- [ ] L0/L1/L2 output levels present
- [ ] Research artifact persisted to filesystem (P-002)
