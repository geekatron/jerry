## Content

### Description

Research prompt engineering patterns that serve as enforcement mechanisms: system prompts, constitutional AI patterns, chain-of-thought enforcement, self-correction prompts, structured output enforcement, and few-shot example patterns. Document effectiveness, reliability, and failure modes for each pattern. Include authoritative citations from Anthropic, OpenAI, and academic literature.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] At least 8 prompt engineering enforcement patterns cataloged (14 cataloged)
- [x] Each pattern: description, mechanism, effectiveness rating, failure modes
- [x] Constitutional AI patterns documented with Anthropic citations
- [x] Self-correction and reflection patterns documented
- [x] Structured output enforcement patterns documented
- [x] L0/L1/L2 output levels present
- [x] Research artifact persisted to filesystem (P-002)

### Implementation Notes

Research completed. 14 patterns cataloged with 9 academic citations and DOIs. Jerry gap analysis with implementation priority matrix produced. Self-assessed quality score: 0.93.
