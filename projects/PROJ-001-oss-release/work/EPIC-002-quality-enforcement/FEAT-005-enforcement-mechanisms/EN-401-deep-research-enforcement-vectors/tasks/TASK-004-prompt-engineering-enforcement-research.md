## Description

Research prompt engineering patterns that serve as enforcement mechanisms: system prompts, constitutional AI patterns, chain-of-thought enforcement, self-correction prompts, structured output enforcement, and few-shot example patterns. Document effectiveness, reliability, and failure modes for each pattern. Include authoritative citations from Anthropic, OpenAI, and academic literature.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least 8 prompt engineering enforcement patterns cataloged
- [ ] Each pattern: description, mechanism, effectiveness rating, failure modes
- [ ] Constitutional AI patterns documented with Anthropic citations
- [ ] Self-correction and reflection patterns documented
- [ ] Structured output enforcement patterns documented
- [ ] L0/L1/L2 output levels present
- [ ] Research artifact persisted to filesystem (P-002)
