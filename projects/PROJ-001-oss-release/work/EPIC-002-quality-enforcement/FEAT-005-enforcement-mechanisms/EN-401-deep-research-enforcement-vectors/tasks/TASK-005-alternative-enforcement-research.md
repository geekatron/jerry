## Description

Exploratory research into emerging and alternative enforcement approaches not covered by standard Claude Code vectors: MCP-based enforcement, tool-use interception patterns, AST-based code analysis guardrails, runtime verification approaches, formal verification methods for LLM outputs, and novel enforcement research from 2024-2026. Cross-domain transfer from other LLM platforms (OpenAI Assistants, Google Gemini, Amazon Bedrock).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least 5 alternative/emerging enforcement approaches identified
- [ ] Cross-platform enforcement patterns analyzed (OpenAI, Google, Amazon)
- [ ] Each approach: name, origin, mechanism, novelty factor, applicability to Claude Code
- [ ] MCP-based enforcement possibilities explored
- [ ] Runtime verification and formal methods assessed
- [ ] L0/L1/L2 output levels present
- [ ] Research artifact persisted to filesystem (P-002)
