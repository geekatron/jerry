## Description

Assess platform portability for each enforcement vector identified in TASK-001 through TASK-005. Categorize vectors as: Claude Code-specific, portable across LLM platforms, or OS-specific. Evaluate macOS/Windows/Linux compatibility for each. Produce a portability matrix with recommendations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every identified enforcement vector assessed for portability
- [ ] Portability matrix: vector × platform compatibility
- [ ] Vectors categorized: Claude-specific, LLM-portable, OS-specific
- [ ] macOS/Windows/Linux compatibility evaluated for each vector
- [ ] Recommendations for maximizing portability
- [ ] L0/L1/L2 output levels present
- [ ] Research artifact persisted to filesystem (P-002)
