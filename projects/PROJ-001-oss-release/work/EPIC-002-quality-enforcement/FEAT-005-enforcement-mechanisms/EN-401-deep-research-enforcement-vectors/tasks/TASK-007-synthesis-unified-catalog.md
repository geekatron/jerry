  Synthesize all research from TASK-001 through TASK-006 into a unified enforcement
  vector catalog. The catalog must enumerate all vectors, provide effectiveness
  ratings, document trade-offs, include a decision matrix for vector selection,
  and produce a recommended enforcement architecture for Jerry.

## Content

### Description

Synthesize all research from TASK-001 through TASK-006 into a unified enforcement vector catalog. The catalog must: enumerate all vectors, provide effectiveness ratings, document trade-offs, include a decision matrix for vector selection, and produce a recommended enforcement architecture for Jerry. Include authoritative citations from all research tasks.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All enforcement vectors from TASK-001-006 integrated into single catalog
- [ ] Effectiveness rating (high/medium/low) for each vector
- [ ] Trade-off analysis: enforcement strength vs. flexibility vs. maintenance cost
- [ ] Decision matrix for selecting enforcement vectors by use case
- [ ] Recommended enforcement architecture for Jerry
- [ ] Meta-analysis identifying patterns across vectors
- [ ] L0/L1/L2 output levels present
- [ ] Synthesis artifact persisted to filesystem (P-002)

### Implementation Notes

Blocked by TASK-001 through TASK-006. This is the critical synthesis step that produces the unified catalog feeding into adversarial review.
