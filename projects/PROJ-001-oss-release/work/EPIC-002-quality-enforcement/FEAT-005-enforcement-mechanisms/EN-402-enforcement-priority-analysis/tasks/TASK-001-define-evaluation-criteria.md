### Description

Establish weighted evaluation criteria for scoring enforcement vectors across four dimensions: effectiveness, implementation cost, platform portability, and maintainability. Define a clear scoring methodology with justification for weight assignments that will be used in the priority matrix.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Evaluation criteria defined for effectiveness, implementation cost, platform portability, and maintainability
- [ ] Weighting methodology established with clear justification for each weight
- [ ] Scoring scale defined (e.g., 1-5 or 1-10) with rubric for each criterion
- [ ] Methodology documented in a reusable format for consistent application across all vectors
- [ ] Criteria reviewed for completeness and absence of bias

### Implementation Notes

First task in EN-402. No dependencies within this enabler. Requires EN-401 research catalog as input.
