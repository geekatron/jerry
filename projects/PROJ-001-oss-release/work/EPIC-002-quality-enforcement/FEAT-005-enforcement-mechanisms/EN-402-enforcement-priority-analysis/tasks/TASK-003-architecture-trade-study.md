## Content

### Description

Evaluate how enforcement vectors compose, conflict, or reinforce each other in a layered enforcement architecture. Analyze vector interactions to determine which combinations produce the strongest enforcement posture and which create conflicts or redundancies.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Vector composition analysis completed showing synergies and conflicts
- [ ] Layered enforcement architecture options evaluated (at least 3 alternatives)
- [ ] Trade-offs documented for each architecture option (cost, complexity, coverage)
- [ ] Recommendation produced for optimal vector composition strategy
- [ ] Trade study artifact persisted to filesystem

### Implementation Notes

Can run in parallel with TASK-002. Uses EN-401 unified catalog as input.
