## Content

### Description

Design a tiered enforcement strategy that distinguishes simple tasks (where lightweight enforcement suffices) from complex tasks (where full quality framework engagement is mandatory). Define threshold criteria for task complexity classification and enforcement level selection.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Task complexity classification criteria defined (simple vs complex thresholds)
- [ ] Enforcement levels defined for each tier with specific requirements per level
- [ ] Escalation rules defined for when simple tasks become complex
- [ ] Strategy is clear and unambiguous for Claude to follow without human intervention
- [ ] Design document produced with decision matrix and examples

### Implementation Notes

Depends on TASK-001 (requirements) and TASK-002 (gap audit). Outputs feed TASK-004 (HARD enforcement patterns) and TASK-005/006/007 (implementation).
