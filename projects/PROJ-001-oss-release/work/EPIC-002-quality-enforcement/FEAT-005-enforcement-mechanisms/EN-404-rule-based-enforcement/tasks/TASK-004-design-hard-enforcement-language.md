### Description

Design HARD enforcement language patterns that are unambiguous and non-overridable by Claude. Create a catalog of enforcement language templates that distinguish between advisory guidance (SOFT) and mandatory constraints (HARD), with clear formatting conventions that Claude will respect.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] HARD enforcement language patterns defined with clear formatting conventions
- [ ] Distinction between SOFT (advisory) and HARD (mandatory) enforcement documented
