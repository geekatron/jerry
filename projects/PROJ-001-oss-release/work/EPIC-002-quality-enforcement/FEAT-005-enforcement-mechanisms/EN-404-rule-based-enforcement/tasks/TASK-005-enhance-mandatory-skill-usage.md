### Description

Enhance the mandatory-skill-usage.md rule file with stronger enforcement directives using the HARD enforcement language patterns from TASK-004. Add explicit quality gate requirements, tiered enforcement triggers from TASK-003, and non-overridable constraints for skill invocation.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] mandatory-skill-usage.md updated with HARD enforcement language patterns
- [ ] Quality gate requirements added for each mandatory skill
- [ ] Tiered enforcement triggers integrated (simple vs complex task handling)
- [ ] Non-overridable constraints clearly marked and formatted
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained with existing skill invocation workflows

### Implementation Notes

Depends on TASK-003 (tiered strategy) and TASK-004 (HARD patterns). Can be done in parallel with TASK-006 and TASK-007.
