## Content

### Description

Audit all 7 FEAT-003 enablers (EN-201 through EN-207) and their deliverables. For each enabler, catalog:
- What was delivered (code, documentation, configuration changes)
- Current state of the deliverable (file paths, line counts)
- Risk level for adversarial review (high/medium/low)
- Dependencies on other deliverables

The 7 enablers to audit:
1. EN-201 -- context audit and baseline
2. EN-202 -- CLAUDE.md rewrite
3. EN-203 -- rule consolidation
4. EN-204 -- bootstrap context creation
5. EN-205 -- context injection optimization
6. EN-206 -- context distribution
7. EN-207 -- validation and verification

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 7 enablers cataloged with deliverable inventory
- [ ] Risk levels assigned to each deliverable
- [ ] Priority order for adversarial review determined
- [ ] Audit report persisted as deliverable

### Implementation Notes

Focus on identifying the highest-risk deliverables for adversarial review. EN-206 (context distribution) and EN-202 (CLAUDE.md rewrite) are expected to be highest priority based on their impact scope.
