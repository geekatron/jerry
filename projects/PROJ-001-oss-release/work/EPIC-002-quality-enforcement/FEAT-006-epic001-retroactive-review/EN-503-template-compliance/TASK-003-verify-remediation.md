## Content

### Description

Re-audit all EPIC-001 entity files after remediation (TASK-002) to confirm 100% template compliance. Verify:

1. All previously non-compliant files now pass compliance checks
2. No regressions introduced (existing content preserved)
3. Navigation tables are functional (anchor links resolve correctly)
4. Hyperlinks between files are valid

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Re-audit confirms 100% template compliance
- [ ] No regressions in existing content
- [ ] All navigation table anchor links resolve
- [ ] All inter-file hyperlinks valid
- [ ] Verification report persisted as deliverable

### Implementation Notes

Compare the re-audit results against the TASK-001 audit report. Every gap identified in TASK-001 should now show as resolved. Spot-check content preservation by comparing key sections before and after remediation.
