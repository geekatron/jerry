## Content

### Description

Audit all 8 FEAT-002 enablers (EN-101 through EN-108) and their deliverables. For each enabler, catalog:
- What was delivered (research outputs, preparation artifacts, configuration)
- Current state of the deliverable
- Downstream impact (which features/enablers depend on this research)
- Risk level for adversarial review (high/medium/low)

The 8 enablers to audit:
1. EN-101 through EN-107 -- Research and preparation enablers
2. EN-108 -- Version bumping procedure

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 8 enablers cataloged with deliverable inventory
- [ ] Downstream dependencies mapped for each deliverable
- [ ] Risk levels assigned to each deliverable
- [ ] Priority order for adversarial review determined
- [ ] Audit report persisted as deliverable

### Implementation Notes

EN-108 (version bumping) is expected to be highest priority due to its operational impact on releases. Research outputs should be evaluated for accuracy and completeness of conclusions that inform downstream decisions.
