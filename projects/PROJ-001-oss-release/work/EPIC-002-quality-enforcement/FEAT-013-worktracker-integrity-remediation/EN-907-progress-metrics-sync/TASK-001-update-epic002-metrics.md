### Description

Update EPIC-002 progress from 0% to ~14% (4/29 enablers). Update FEAT-004 from 5% to ~29%. Update FEAT-005 from 5% to ~33%. These top-level progress metrics in the feature and epic files are stale and do not reflect the actual completion of EN-301, EN-302, EN-401, and EN-402.

Specific updates:
- EPIC-002: Progress bar and metrics table to show 4/29 enablers completed (~14%)
- FEAT-004: Progress bar and metrics table to show 2/7 enablers completed (~29%)
- FEAT-005: Progress bar and metrics table to show 2/6 enablers completed (~33%)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] EPIC-002 progress section shows 4/29 enablers completed (~14%)
- [ ] FEAT-004 progress section shows 2/7 enablers completed (~29%)
- [ ] FEAT-005 progress section shows 2/6 enablers completed (~33%)
- [ ] Progress bars visually reflect updated percentages

### Implementation Notes

Cross-reference each enabler status file to confirm completion state before updating parent metrics. Use the same progress bar format as existing files (ASCII art with percentage).
