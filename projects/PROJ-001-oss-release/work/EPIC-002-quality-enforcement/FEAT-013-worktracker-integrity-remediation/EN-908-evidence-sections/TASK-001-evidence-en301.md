## Content

### Description

Add Evidence section to EN-301 with links to research-15-adversarial-strategies.md, quality scores (0.936), task file inventory, commit refs. EN-301 is a completed enabler that currently lacks a structured Evidence section documenting its deliverables and verification results.

The Evidence section should include:
- Deliverables table listing research document, task outputs, and quality scores
- Technical Verification table mapping acceptance criteria to evidence
- Verification Checklist with all items checked (since enabler is completed)
- Quality score: 0.936 (weighted composite from creator-critic-revision cycle)
- Link to: research-15-adversarial-strategies.md

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] EN-301 has Evidence section with Deliverables table
- [ ] Evidence includes quality score 0.936
- [ ] Evidence links to research-15-adversarial-strategies.md
- [ ] Task file inventory listed in deliverables
- [ ] Commit references included where available

### Implementation Notes

Follow the Evidence section format from the enabler template (see EN-901 for reference structure). The Evidence section should be placed between Acceptance Criteria and Risks and Mitigations sections.
