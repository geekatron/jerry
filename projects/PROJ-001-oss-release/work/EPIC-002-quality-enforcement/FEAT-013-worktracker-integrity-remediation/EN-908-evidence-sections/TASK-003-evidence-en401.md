## Content

### Description

Add Evidence section to EN-401 with links to research-enforcement-vectors.md, quality scores (0.928), 62-vector catalog. EN-401 is a completed enabler that currently lacks a structured Evidence section documenting its deliverables and verification results.

The Evidence section should include:
- Deliverables table listing research document, 62-vector catalog, task outputs, and quality scores
- Technical Verification table mapping acceptance criteria to evidence
- Verification Checklist with all items checked (since enabler is completed)
- Quality score: 0.928 (weighted composite from creator-critic-revision cycle)
- Link to: research-enforcement-vectors.md (62-vector enforcement catalog)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] EN-401 has Evidence section with Deliverables table
- [ ] Evidence includes quality score 0.928
- [ ] Evidence links to research-enforcement-vectors.md
- [ ] 62-vector catalog referenced in deliverables
- [ ] Commit references included where available

### Implementation Notes

Follow the Evidence section format from the enabler template. The 62-vector catalog is a key deliverable from the enforcement architecture research.
