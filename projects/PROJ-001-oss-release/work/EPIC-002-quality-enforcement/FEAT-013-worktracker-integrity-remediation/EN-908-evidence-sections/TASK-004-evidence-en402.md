### Description

Add Evidence section to EN-402 with links to ADR-EPIC002-002, quality scores (0.923), task deliverables. EN-402 is a completed enabler that currently lacks a structured Evidence section documenting its deliverables and verification results.

The Evidence section should include:
- Deliverables table listing ADR-EPIC002-002, task outputs, and quality scores
- Technical Verification table mapping acceptance criteria to evidence
- Verification Checklist with all items checked (since enabler is completed)
- Quality score: 0.923 (weighted composite from creator-critic-revision cycle)
- Link to: ADR-EPIC002-002 (5-layer enforcement architecture ADR)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] EN-402 has Evidence section with Deliverables table
- [ ] Evidence includes quality score 0.923
- [ ] Evidence links to ADR-EPIC002-002
- [ ] Task deliverables listed in deliverables table
- [ ] Commit references included where available

### Implementation Notes

Follow the Evidence section format from the enabler template. ADR-EPIC002-002 covers the 5-layer enforcement architecture and token budgets.
