### Description

Update FEAT-004 and FEAT-005 acceptance criteria to reflect partial satisfaction by completed enablers. Currently the acceptance criteria show all items as unchecked, but completed enablers (EN-301/EN-302 for FEAT-004, EN-401/EN-402 for FEAT-005) have satisfied some criteria.

Specific updates:
- FEAT-004: Check acceptance criteria items satisfied by EN-301 (adversarial strategy research) and EN-302 (strategy selection ADR)
- FEAT-005: Check acceptance criteria items satisfied by EN-401 (enforcement vector research) and EN-402 (enforcement architecture ADR)
- Add notes indicating which enabler satisfied each checked criterion

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] FEAT-004 acceptance criteria reflect EN-301/EN-302 completion
- [ ] FEAT-005 acceptance criteria reflect EN-401/EN-402 completion
- [ ] Each checked criterion has a note indicating which enabler satisfied it
- [ ] Unchecked criteria remain unchecked

### Implementation Notes

Cross-reference each enabler's deliverables with the feature-level acceptance criteria to determine which criteria have been satisfied. Only check criteria that are fully satisfied, not partially.
