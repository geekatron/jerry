## Summary

Extract all quality framework constants from EPIC-002 design documents (EN-403, EN-404, EN-405, Final Synthesis, ADR-EPIC002-001, ADR-EPIC002-002). Produce a complete inventory of every constant value referenced across the design: criticality levels (C1-C4), quality threshold (0.92), strategy encodings (S-001 through S-014), cycle count (3 iterations), tier vocabulary (HARD/MEDIUM/SOFT), auto-escalation rules (AE-001 through AE-006), and 5-layer architecture definitions (L1-L5).

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All EPIC-002 design documents surveyed for constant references
- [ ] Criticality levels C1-C4 extracted with definitions
- [ ] Quality threshold (0.92) and scoring dimensions extracted
- [ ] Strategy encodings S-001 through S-014 extracted with descriptions
- [ ] Cycle count (3 iterations minimum) extracted
- [ ] Tier vocabulary (HARD/MEDIUM/SOFT) definitions extracted
- [ ] Auto-escalation rules AE-001 through AE-006 extracted
- [ ] 5-layer architecture reference (L1-L5) extracted
- [ ] Inventory document produced listing all constants with source references
