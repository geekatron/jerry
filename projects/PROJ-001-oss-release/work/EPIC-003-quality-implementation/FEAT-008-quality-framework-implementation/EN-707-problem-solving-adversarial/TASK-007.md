## Summary

Address all findings from the TASK-006 adversarial review. Revise deliverables from TASK-001 through TASK-005 to resolve identified gaps, inconsistencies, and quality issues. Ensure all revised deliverables meet the >= 0.92 quality threshold upon completion.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All critical and major findings from TASK-006 review addressed
- [ ] Minor findings addressed or documented with rationale for deferral
- [ ] Revised deliverables meet >= 0.92 quality threshold
- [ ] Revision changelog documenting what changed and why
- [ ] All revised files maintain markdown navigation standards (NAV-001 through NAV-006)
- [ ] SSOT references remain consistent after revision

## Implementation Notes

- This task is blocked until TASK-006 (adversarial review) is complete
- Work through findings systematically: critical first, then major, then minor
- For each finding, either revise the deliverable or document rationale for not addressing
- If a finding requires changes to multiple files, ensure consistency across all updates
- Run a self-check against the quality rubric after revisions
