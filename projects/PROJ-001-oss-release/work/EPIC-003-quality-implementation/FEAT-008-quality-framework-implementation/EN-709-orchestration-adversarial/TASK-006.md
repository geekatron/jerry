## Summary

Conduct an adversarial review of all changes produced by TASK-001 through TASK-005 for the orchestration skill enhancement. Apply structured adversarial critique to each deliverable, scoring against the quality rubric (>= 0.92 threshold). Assess phase gate protocol completeness, sync barrier integration, cross-pollination enhancement, and agent responsibility clarity. Produce a review report with actionable findings for TASK-007 revision.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All deliverables from TASK-001 through TASK-005 reviewed
- [ ] Each deliverable scored against quality rubric dimensions
- [ ] Phase gate protocol completeness assessed
- [ ] Sync barrier integration validated
- [ ] Cross-pollination enhancement reviewed for consistency with existing mechanics
- [ ] Gaps and inconsistencies documented with specific citations
