## Summary

Address all findings from the TASK-006 adversarial review of orchestration skill changes. Revise deliverables from TASK-001 through TASK-005 to resolve identified gaps in phase gate protocol, sync barrier integration, cross-pollination enhancement, and agent responsibility clarity. Ensure all revised deliverables meet the >= 0.92 quality threshold.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All critical and major findings from TASK-006 review addressed
- [ ] Minor findings addressed or documented with rationale for deferral
- [ ] Revised deliverables meet >= 0.92 quality threshold
- [ ] Phase gate protocol gaps resolved
- [ ] Sync barrier integration issues resolved
- [ ] Cross-pollination enhancement issues resolved
- [ ] Revision changelog documenting what changed and why
- [ ] All revised files maintain markdown navigation standards (NAV-001 through NAV-006)

---

## Implementation Notes

- This task is blocked until TASK-006 (adversarial review) is complete
- Work through findings systematically: critical first, then major, then minor
- Pay special attention to ensuring revised phase gate protocol is complete and unambiguous
- Verify that cross-pollination changes still preserve existing orchestration mechanics after revision
- Run a self-check against the quality rubric after revisions
