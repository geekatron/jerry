## Summary

Survey existing templates in `.context/templates/` -- specifically design/, worktracker/, and requirements/ directories -- to identify common structural patterns, section conventions, field formats, and placeholder usage. Produce an inventory of patterns that can be adapted for adversarial strategy templates, noting which elements are universal (apply to all templates) and which are domain-specific (unique to design, worktracker, or requirements).

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All template directories surveyed: design/, worktracker/, requirements/
- [ ] Common structural patterns identified (section ordering, field conventions, placeholder syntax)
- [ ] Universal patterns distinguished from domain-specific patterns
- [ ] Gaps identified where existing patterns do not cover adversarial strategy needs
- [ ] Research summary document produced with pattern inventory and recommendations
- [ ] Quality gate: Deliverable reviewed via creator-critic-revision cycle (min 3 iterations)
- [ ] Quality gate: Score >= 0.92 via S-014 LLM-as-Judge rubric
- [ ] Quality gate: S-003 Steelman applied before S-002 Devil's Advocate critique
