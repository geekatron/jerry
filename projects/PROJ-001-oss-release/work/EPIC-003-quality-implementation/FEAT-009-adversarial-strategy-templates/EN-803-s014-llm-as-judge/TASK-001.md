## Summary

Extract the LLM-as-Judge methodology from research-15-adversarial-strategies.md and cross-reference with quality-enforcement.md dimensions (Completeness 0.20, Internal Consistency 0.20, Methodological Rigor 0.20, Evidence Quality 0.15, Actionability 0.15, Traceability 0.10) and weights. Produce a methodology extraction document covering the scoring paradigm, bias mitigation techniques, dimension-level rubric foundations, and integration patterns with the creator-critic-revision cycle.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] research-15-adversarial-strategies.md surveyed for S-014 LLM-as-Judge content
- [ ] EPIC-002 design documents surveyed for S-014 references and usage patterns
- [ ] Scoring paradigm extracted (how LLM-as-Judge evaluates deliverables)
- [ ] Bias mitigation techniques extracted (leniency bias countermeasures)
- [ ] 6-dimension rubric foundations extracted and cross-referenced with quality-enforcement.md weights
- [ ] Integration patterns with creator-critic-revision cycle documented
- [ ] Methodology extraction document produced with source references
- [ ] Quality gate: Deliverable reviewed via creator-critic-revision cycle (min 3 iterations)
- [ ] Quality gate: Score >= 0.92 via S-014 LLM-as-Judge rubric
- [ ] Quality gate: S-003 Steelman applied before S-002 Devil's Advocate critique
