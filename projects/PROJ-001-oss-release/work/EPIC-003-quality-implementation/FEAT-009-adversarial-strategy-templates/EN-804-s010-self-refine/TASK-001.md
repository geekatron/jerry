## Summary

Extract the Self-Refine methodology from research-15-adversarial-strategies.md and EPIC-002 design documents. Map the methodology to the H-15 self-review requirement, identifying how the generate-critique-refine paradigm applies to mandatory self-review before presenting deliverables. Document the iteration protocol, convergence criteria, and integration with the broader quality cycle.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] research-15-adversarial-strategies.md surveyed for S-010 Self-Refine content
- [ ] EPIC-002 design documents surveyed for S-010 references and H-15 usage
- [ ] Generate-critique-refine paradigm extracted with step descriptions
- [ ] Iteration protocol extracted (how many iterations, when to stop)
- [ ] Convergence criteria identified from research
- [ ] Mapping to H-15 mandatory self-review requirement documented
- [ ] Interaction pattern with S-014 LLM-as-Judge identified
- [ ] Methodology extraction document produced with source references
- [ ] Quality gate: Deliverable reviewed via creator-critic-revision cycle (min 3 iterations)
- [ ] Quality gate: Score >= 0.92 via S-014 LLM-as-Judge rubric
- [ ] Quality gate: S-003 Steelman applied before S-002 Devil's Advocate critique
