## Summary

Extract the Constitutional AI Critique methodology from research-15-adversarial-strategies.md and map it to the Jerry framework's principle system. Survey all `.context/rules/` files to build a comprehensive inventory of HARD rules H-01 through H-24. Cross-reference with `docs/governance/JERRY_CONSTITUTION.md` for constitutional governance principles. Document the review paradigm, violation classification approach, and integration patterns with the C2+ quality cycle.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] research-15-adversarial-strategies.md surveyed for S-007 Constitutional AI content
- [ ] EPIC-002 design documents surveyed for S-007 references and H-18 usage

- [ ] All `.context/rules/` files surveyed for HARD rule definitions
- [ ] Complete inventory of H-01 through H-24 with source file for each rule
- [ ] Auto-escalation rules AE-001 through AE-006 inventoried
- [ ] `docs/governance/JERRY_CONSTITUTION.md` surveyed for constitutional principles
- [ ] Mapping from research methodology to Jerry principle system documented
