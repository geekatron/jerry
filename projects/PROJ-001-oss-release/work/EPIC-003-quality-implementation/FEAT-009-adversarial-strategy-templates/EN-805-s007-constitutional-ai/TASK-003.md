## Summary

Apply the full creator-critic-revision quality cycle to the S-007 Constitutional AI Critique template produced by TASK-002. Execute S-003 Steelman first to identify the strongest aspects and charitable interpretations, then apply S-002 Devil's Advocate to surface weaknesses and gaps, then score via S-014 LLM-as-Judge rubric. Iterate through minimum 3 cycles until the template achieves >= 0.92 weighted composite score.
