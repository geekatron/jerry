## Summary
Extract Devil's Advocate methodology from research-15-adversarial-strategies.md Strategy 3. This research task identifies the core protocol elements needed for the S-002 execution template. The extraction must capture the full structured dissent methodology including role assignment, assumption extraction, counter-argument construction, structured presentation, response requirements, and synthesis steps.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Devil's Advocate methodology extracted from research doc Strategy 3
- [ ] Role assignment mechanics documented (who plays devil's advocate, rotation protocol)
- [ ] Assumption extraction process captured (how to surface implicit assumptions)
- [ ] Counter-argument construction steps identified (how to build strongest counterarguments)
- [ ] Structured presentation format documented (how to present dissent findings)
- [ ] Response requirement format captured (what the original author must address)
- [ ] Synthesis protocol documented (how to integrate critique into revised deliverable)
- [ ] Quality gate: Deliverable reviewed via creator-critic-revision cycle (min 3 iterations)
- [ ] Quality gate: Score >= 0.92 via S-014 LLM-as-Judge rubric
- [ ] Quality gate: S-003 Steelman applied before S-002 Devil's Advocate critique
