## Summary
Create the S-002 Devil's Advocate execution template at `.context/templates/adversarial/S-002-devils-advocate.md` following TEMPLATE-FORMAT.md. The template must include all 8 canonical sections: Purpose and Context, When to Use, Protocol Steps, Input/Output Format, Quality Criteria, Integration Points, Examples, and Anti-Patterns. Key deliverables within the template include a counter-argument construction protocol with DA-NNN identifiers for traceability, an assumption extraction checklist covering at least 5 categories, and a structured response requirement format that ensures actionable outcomes from the critique.
