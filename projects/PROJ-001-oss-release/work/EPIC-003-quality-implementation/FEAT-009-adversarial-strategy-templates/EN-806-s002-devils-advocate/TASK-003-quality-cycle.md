## Summary
Apply the creator-critic-revision quality cycle to the S-002 Devil's Advocate template. The review must follow the mandated sequence: first apply S-003 Steelman to charitably reconstruct the template's strongest interpretation, then apply S-002 Devil's Advocate to challenge assumptions and identify weaknesses, then apply S-014 LLM-as-Judge scoring against the quality rubric. Minimum 3 iterations required. Target quality score >= 0.92.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] S-003 Steelman applied first -- strongest interpretation of template constructed
- [ ] S-002 Devil's Advocate applied -- structured dissent with DA-NNN identifiers
- [ ] S-014 LLM-as-Judge scoring applied with dimension-level rubric
- [ ] Minimum 3 creator-critic-revision iterations completed
- [ ] Final quality score >= 0.92 weighted composite
- [ ] All scoring dimensions assessed: Completeness (0.20), Internal Consistency (0.20), Methodological Rigor (0.20), Evidence Quality (0.15), Actionability (0.15), Traceability (0.10)
- [ ] Revision history documented with score progression
- [ ] Quality gate: Deliverable reviewed via creator-critic-revision cycle (min 3 iterations)
- [ ] Quality gate: Score >= 0.92 via S-014 LLM-as-Judge rubric
- [ ] Quality gate: S-003 Steelman applied before S-002 Devil's Advocate critique
