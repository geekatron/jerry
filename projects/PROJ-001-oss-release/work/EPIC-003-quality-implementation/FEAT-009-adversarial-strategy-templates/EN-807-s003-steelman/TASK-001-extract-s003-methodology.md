## Summary
Extract Steelman methodology from research-15-adversarial-strategies.md Strategy 4. This research task identifies the core protocol elements needed for the S-003 execution template. The extraction must capture the full charitable reconstruction methodology including deep understanding, presentation vs substance weakness distinction, argument reconstruction, best-case scenario construction, and baseline establishment for subsequent critique.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Steelman methodology extracted from research doc Strategy 4
- [ ] Deep understanding protocol captured (how to interpret deliverable charitably)
- [ ] Presentation vs substance weakness distinction documented (surface issues vs fundamental flaws)
- [ ] Argument reconstruction process identified (how to build strongest-form interpretation)
- [ ] Best-case scenario construction steps captured (how to construct optimal reading)
- [ ] Baseline establishment protocol documented (how steelman output feeds into S-002 critique)
- [ ] Quality gate: Deliverable reviewed via creator-critic-revision cycle (min 3 iterations)
- [ ] Quality gate: Score >= 0.92 via S-014 LLM-as-Judge rubric
- [ ] Quality gate: S-003 Steelman applied before S-002 Devil's Advocate critique
