## Summary
Create the S-003 Steelman execution template at `.context/templates/adversarial/S-003-steelman.md` following TEMPLATE-FORMAT.md. The template must include all 8 canonical sections: Purpose and Context, When to Use, Protocol Steps, Input/Output Format, Quality Criteria, Integration Points, Examples, and Anti-Patterns. Key deliverables within the template include a charitable reconstruction protocol with SM-NNN identifiers for traceability, strongest-form argument construction steps, and explicit integration guidance with S-002 Devil's Advocate documenting how Steelman must precede Devil's Advocate per H-16.
