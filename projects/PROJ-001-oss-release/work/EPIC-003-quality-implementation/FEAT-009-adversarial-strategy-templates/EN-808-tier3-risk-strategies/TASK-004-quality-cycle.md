## Summary
Apply the creator-critic-revision quality cycle to all 3 Tier 3 risk strategy templates (S-004 Pre-Mortem, S-012 FMEA, S-013 Inversion). Each template must be reviewed independently following the mandated sequence: first apply S-003 Steelman to charitably reconstruct the template's strongest interpretation, then apply S-002 Devil's Advocate to challenge assumptions and identify weaknesses, then apply S-014 LLM-as-Judge scoring against the quality rubric. Additionally, review cross-template consistency to ensure complementary integration points are correctly documented. Minimum 3 iterations per template. Target quality score >= 0.92 for each.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] S-003 Steelman applied to each of the 3 templates
- [ ] S-002 Devil's Advocate applied to each of the 3 templates
- [ ] S-014 LLM-as-Judge scoring applied to each of the 3 templates
- [ ] Minimum 3 creator-critic-revision iterations completed per template
- [ ] Final quality score >= 0.92 weighted composite for S-004 Pre-Mortem
- [ ] Final quality score >= 0.92 weighted composite for S-012 FMEA
- [ ] Final quality score >= 0.92 weighted composite for S-013 Inversion
- [ ] Cross-template consistency verified (integration points align between all 3)
- [ ] All scoring dimensions assessed per template: Completeness (0.20), Internal Consistency (0.20), Methodological Rigor (0.20), Evidence Quality (0.15), Actionability (0.15), Traceability (0.10)
- [ ] Revision history documented with score progression for each template
- [ ] Quality gate: Deliverable reviewed via creator-critic-revision cycle (min 3 iterations)
- [ ] Quality gate: Score >= 0.92 via S-014 LLM-as-Judge rubric
- [ ] Quality gate: S-003 Steelman applied before S-002 Devil's Advocate critique
