## Content

### Description

Add Business Value, Progress Summary, and Evidence sections to all 11 enabler files under FEAT-008. These enablers implemented the quality framework infrastructure (SSOT, hooks, enforcement engines, skill adversarial modes). Use background agents to parallelize across enabler files.

Target files (11 enablers):
- EN-701 through EN-711
- Located in `work/EPIC-003-quality-implementation/FEAT-008-quality-framework-implementation/EN-*/EN-*.md`

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 11 FEAT-008 enabler files have Business Value section with Features Unlocked
- [ ] All 11 FEAT-008 enabler files have Progress Summary section with accurate metrics
- [ ] All 11 FEAT-008 enabler files have Evidence section (Deliverables + Verification Checklist)
- [ ] Navigation tables updated to list all present sections

### Implementation Notes

Files are in `work/EPIC-003-quality-implementation/FEAT-008-quality-framework-implementation/EN-*/EN-*.md`. These enablers are all completed (all PASS >= 0.92), so Evidence sections should reference their orchestration artifacts. Progress Summary should reflect 100% completion. Business Value should describe the quality framework capability each enabler delivers.
