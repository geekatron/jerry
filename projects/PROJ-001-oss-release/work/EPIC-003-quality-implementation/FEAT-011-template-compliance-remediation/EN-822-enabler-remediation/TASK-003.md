## Content

### Description

Add Business Value, Progress Summary, and Evidence sections to all 7 enabler files under FEAT-010. These enablers are tournament remediation items (still pending). Use background agents to parallelize across enabler files.

Target files (7 enablers):
- EN-813 through EN-819
- Located in `work/EPIC-003-quality-implementation/FEAT-010-tournament-remediation/EN-*/EN-*.md`

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 7 FEAT-010 enabler files have Business Value section with Features Unlocked
- [ ] All 7 FEAT-010 enabler files have Progress Summary section with accurate metrics
- [ ] All 7 FEAT-010 enabler files have Evidence section (Deliverables + Verification Checklist)
- [ ] Navigation tables updated to list all present sections

### Implementation Notes

Files are in `work/EPIC-003-quality-implementation/FEAT-010-tournament-remediation/EN-*/EN-*.md`. These enablers are pending, so Evidence sections should be empty templates ready for population upon completion. Progress Summary should reflect current task completion status. Business Value should describe the tournament remediation capability each enabler will deliver.
