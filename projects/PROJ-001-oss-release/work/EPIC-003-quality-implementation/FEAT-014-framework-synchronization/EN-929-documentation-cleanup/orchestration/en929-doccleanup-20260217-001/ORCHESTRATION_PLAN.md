## Scope

Five tasks from EN-929, assessed across three phases:

| Task | Description | Phase | Criticality |
|------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| TASK-001 | Adversarial template naming in adversary SKILL.md | 2 (Execute C1) | C1 |
| TASK-002 | Agent vs template READMEs in PS and NSE agent dirs | 2 (Execute C1) | C1 |
| TASK-003 | Orchestration pattern reference in architecture-standards.md | 3 (Execute C3) | C3 |
| TASK-004 | Verify H-16 in quality-enforcement.md HARD Rule Index | 3 (Execute C3) | C3 |
| TASK-005 | "When NOT to Use" guidance in adversary SKILL.md | 2 (Execute C1) | C1 |

**Note on TASK-004:** H-16 is already confirmed present in loaded context (`quality-enforcement.md`
HARD Rule Index). Phase 1 verification will likely classify this as N/A, reducing Phase 3 scope
to TASK-003 only.

## Phase Definitions

### Phase 1: VERIFY

**L0 (Stakeholder):** Confirm which of the 5 EN-929 tasks still need doing before touching any files.

**L1 (Developer):**

| Step | Action | Tool |
|------|--------|------|
| 1.1 | Read `skills/adversary/SKILL.md` | Read |
| 1.2 | Read `skills/problem-solving/agents/` directory listing | Bash (ls) |
| 1.3 | Read `skills/nasa-se/agents/` directory listing | Bash (ls) |
| 1.4 | Read `.context/rules/architecture-standards.md` (search for orchestration references) | Read / Grep |
| 1.5 | Read `.context/rules/quality-enforcement.md` HARD Rule Index (verify H-16 entry) | Grep |

**L2 (Implementation):**

For each task, output a classification table:

| Task | File(s) | Finding | Classification |
|------|---------|---------|----------------|
| TASK-001 | skills/adversary/SKILL.md | Check Dependencies section for template naming clarity | APPLICABLE / N/A |
| TASK-002 | skills/problem-solving/agents/, skills/nasa-se/agents/ | Check if README files exist | APPLICABLE / N/A |
| TASK-003 | .context/rules/architecture-standards.md | Check for orchestration pattern reference | APPLICABLE / N/A |
| TASK-004 | .context/rules/quality-enforcement.md | H-16 row in HARD Rule Index | APPLICABLE / N/A |
| TASK-005 | skills/adversary/SKILL.md | Check "When NOT to Use" section | APPLICABLE / N/A |

**Criticality:** C1 (read-only, reversible, no files modified)
**Output:** In-context verification table, used as input to Phase 2 execution decisions.

---

### Phase 2: EXECUTE C1 TASKS

**L0 (Stakeholder):** Apply documentation improvements to skill files and agent directory READMEs.

**L1 (Developer):**

| Step | Action | Files Modified |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 2.1 | Edit `skills/adversary/SKILL.md` — clarify template naming (TASK-001) AND improve "When NOT to Use" guidance (TASK-005) in a single pass | skills/adversary/SKILL.md |
| 2.2 | Create `skills/problem-solving/agents/README.md` distinguishing agent vs template files (TASK-002) | skills/problem-solving/agents/README.md |
| 2.3 | Create `skills/nasa-se/agents/README.md` distinguishing agent vs template files (TASK-002) | skills/nasa-se/agents/README.md |
| 2.4 | Apply S-010 self-review to all modified/created files | (in-context review) |

**L2 (Implementation):**

- TASK-001 + TASK-005 share the same target file. Combine into one Edit call with both changes to avoid double-editing. Read file first, plan both changes, apply atomically.
- TASK-002 READMEs: each should briefly explain that `agents/` contains agent instruction files (`.md`) and that template files live in `.context/templates/` — not here. Keep under 30 lines (no navigation table required per NAV-001).
- S-010 self-review: check each output for accuracy, consistency with existing content, and absence of introduced errors before proceeding.

**Criticality:** C1 (skill docs, agent dirs, reversible in 1 session, no governance files)
**Quality enforcement:** S-010 self-review only.
**Output:** 1 edited file + 2 new README files.

---

### Phase 3: EXECUTE C3 TASKS

**L0 (Stakeholder):** Apply documentation improvements to governance rule files under `.context/rules/`.

**L1 (Developer):**

| Step | Action | Files Modified |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 3.1 | If TASK-003 APPLICABLE: Edit `.context/rules/architecture-standards.md` to add orchestration pattern reference | .context/rules/architecture-standards.md |
| 3.2 | If TASK-004 APPLICABLE: Edit `.context/rules/quality-enforcement.md` to verify/fix H-16 row | .context/rules/quality-enforcement.md |
| 3.3 | Apply C3 quality strategy set to proposed changes before writing | (in-context) |

**L2 (Implementation):**

Quality strategy execution for C3 (apply before making edits, or to draft edits before finalizing):

| Strategy | ID | Focus |
|----------|----|-------|
| Constitutional AI Critique | S-007 | Ensure changes comply with governance and do not contradict existing rules |
| Devil's Advocate | S-002 | Challenge whether the change is necessary or could cause confusion |
| LLM-as-Judge | S-014 | Score proposed edit against 6-dimension rubric (threshold >= 0.92) |
| Pre-Mortem Analysis | S-004 | What could go wrong after this edit is merged? |
| FMEA | S-012 | Identify failure modes in the proposed wording |
| Inversion Technique | S-013 | What would a bad version of this change look like? Use to sharpen the good version. |

Apply strategies in order above. If S-014 score < 0.92, revise before writing to disk.

**Criticality:** C3 (AE-002 auto-escalation — touches `.context/rules/`)
**Quality enforcement:** Full C3 strategy set (S-007, S-002, S-014, S-004, S-012, S-013).
**Output:** 0–2 edited rule files + in-context quality gate score.

---

## Quality Gate

**Location:** Phase 2 → Phase 3 boundary

**Trigger:** AE-002 — Phase 3 touches `.context/rules/` (auto-C3 minimum).

**Requirement:** Before writing any Phase 3 edits to disk, apply the full C3 strategy set to the
proposed changes. S-014 score MUST be >= 0.92. If below threshold, revise the proposed edit and
re-score. Do not write until threshold is met.

| Gate Field | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Threshold | >= 0.92 (H-13) |
| Scoring | S-014 LLM-as-Judge, 6-dimension rubric |
| Required strategies | S-007, S-002, S-014, S-004, S-012, S-013 |
| Consequence of FAIL | Revise proposed edit; do not proceed to disk write |

---

## Artifact Paths

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Orchestration Plan (this file) | `orchestration/en929-doccleanup-20260217-001/ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md` |
| Orchestration State | `orchestration/en929-doccleanup-20260217-001/ORCHESTRATION.yaml` |
| Phase 1 output | In-context (verification table, not persisted separately) |
| Phase 2 outputs | `skills/adversary/SKILL.md`, `skills/problem-solving/agents/README.md`, `skills/nasa-se/agents/README.md` |
| Phase 3 outputs | `.context/rules/architecture-standards.md` (if TASK-003 applicable), `.context/rules/quality-enforcement.md` (if TASK-004 applicable) |

All paths above are relative to the repository root.

## Execution Notes

| Note | Detail |
|------|--------|
| P-003 Compliance | This workflow executes in main context only. No subagents spawned. |
| TASK-004 likely N/A | H-16 is confirmed present in loaded `quality-enforcement.md` context. Phase 1 must confirm before skipping. |
| TASK-001 + TASK-005 combined | Both modify `skills/adversary/SKILL.md`. Do in one pass to avoid redundant reads/edits. |
| AE-002 scope | Only TASK-003 and TASK-004 trigger AE-002. TASK-001, TASK-002, TASK-005 do NOT touch `.context/rules/`. |
| Low-priority scope control | This is a minor enabler. Do not expand scope beyond the 5 defined tasks. |
| ORCHESTRATION.yaml updates | Update `current_phase` and task `status` fields after each phase completes. |
