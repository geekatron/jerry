> Project plan for implementing NASA systems engineering practices within Jerry.

---

## Overview

**Project ID:** PROJ-002-nasa-systems-engineering
**Status:** PLANNING
**Created:** 2026-01-09
**Branch:** `cc/proj-nasa-systems-engineering`

### Objective

*To be defined during planning phase.*

### Scope

*To be defined during planning phase.*

---

## Background

NASA's Systems Engineering practices are documented in the **NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (NASA/SP-2016-6105 Rev2)**. These practices provide a structured approach to:

- Requirements definition and management
- System design and integration
- Verification and validation
- Technical reviews and lifecycle gates
- Risk management
- Configuration management

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Research & Discovery
- [ ] Review NASA SE Handbook structure
- [ ] Identify key processes applicable to software projects
- [ ] Map NASA concepts to Jerry framework capabilities

### Phase 2: Design
- [ ] Define domain model for SE concepts
- [ ] Design integration with Work Tracker
- [ ] Create architectural decision records

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Implement core SE domain entities
- [ ] Build SE-specific skills
- [ ] Integrate with existing Jerry infrastructure

### Phase 4: Validation
- [ ] Test against NASA SE guidelines
- [ ] Document learnings and patterns
