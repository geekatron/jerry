## L0: Executive Summary

NASA Technical Review Gates are formal decision points throughout the project lifecycle that ensure technical maturity, verify requirements compliance, and authorize progression to subsequent phases. NPR 7123.1D Appendix G defines 17+ review types with specific entrance criteria, materials requirements, and exit/success criteria. Reviews range from early conceptual (MCR) through detailed design (PDR/CDR), integration/test (SIR/TRR), operational readiness (ORR/FRR), and end-of-life (DR/DRR).

**Key Finding:** All reviews employ a three-part structure: (1) entrance criteria, (2) materials for review, and (3) exit/success criteria. Tailoring is expected and must be justified to the Engineering Technical Authority (ETA).

## L1: Technical Summary

### 1. Overview of NASA Technical Reviews

NASA's technical review framework provides formal assessment gates throughout the system lifecycle, ensuring:

- Technical maturity matches phase requirements
- Requirements are properly derived, allocated, and verified
- Risks are identified and mitigated
- Cost/schedule estimates remain credible
- Stakeholder expectations are addressed

**Primary Authority:** NPR 7123.1D (NASA Systems Engineering Processes and Requirements), effective July 5, 2023, expiration July 5, 2028.

### 2. Review Gate Categories

| Category | Reviews | Lifecycle Phase |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Formulation** | MCR, SRR, MDR/SDR, PDR | Pre-Phase A through Phase B |
| **Implementation** | CDR, PRR, SIR, TRR, DCR, SAR | Phase C through Phase D |
| **Operations** | ORR, MRR/FRR, PLAR, CERR, PFAR | Phase E |
| **Closeout** | DR, DRR | Phase F |

### 3. Three-Part Criteria Structure

Each review defines:

1. **Entrance Criteria:** Prerequisites that must be met before the review can begin (typically 2-4 weeks prior)
2. **Materials for Review:** Documentation and artifacts to be examined during the review
3. **Exit/Success Criteria:** Conditions that must be satisfied for review completion and phase progression

### 4. RFA/RID Process

**Review Item Discrepancy (RID):** Technical issues identified during reviews requiring resolution.

**Request for Action (RFA):** Action items generated during reviews requiring follow-up.

**Classification:**
- **Mission Critical:** Could cause mission failure
- **Major:** Significant impact but not mission-threatening
- **Minor:** Limited impact

**Resolution Status:** Open, Released, Submitted, Closed, Voided

### 5. Tailoring Guidance

Per NPR 7123.1D: "Tailoring and customizing are expected for projects and programs." The decision NOT to tailor must be justified to the ETA.

### Section 2.6: INCOSE Best Practices

Source: [INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook v5.0](https://www.incose.org/publications/products/se-handbook-v4)

#### 2.6.1 Technical Assessment Process

The INCOSE Technical Assessment Process includes:
- Advising on technical reviews and audits
- Defining technical documentation and artifacts serving as review criteria
- Assessing achieved results against defined criteria
- Providing fact-based understanding of technical maturity, program status, and risk

#### 2.6.2 Tailoring Guidance

Per INCOSE:
- "Interim maturity reviews are essential to keep timely awareness"
- "It is necessary to be clear about tailoring the entry/exit criteria - one size does not fit all"
- Decision-making gates can be used to inform progression between stages to reduce risk
- Not all parts of a system will reach the same maturity at the same time

#### 2.6.3 Key Principles

1. **Identify Key Stakeholders:** For any project, identify key stakeholders and address areas of greatest interest
2. **Agree on Tailoring:** Ensure stakeholder understanding and acceptance of tailoring benefits and risks
3. **Apply ISO 15288 Framework:** Use life cycle processes consistent with ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2023
4. **Document Decisions:** Ensure review outcomes are clearly documented and communicated

---

### Section 2.7: Maturity Concepts

#### 2.7.1 Baselining

Products designated "ready to be baselined after review comments incorporated" indicate:
- Achievement of controlled baseline status
- Change management processes activated
- Configuration control applied

#### 2.7.2 Technology Readiness

- Technology development plans require definition with readiness assessments
- New technology must achieve "adequate state of readiness"
- Backup options must be supported before design reviews

#### 2.7.3 TBD/TBR Resolution

- **TBD (To Be Determined):** Missing information requiring resolution
- **TBR (To Be Resolved):** Placeholder values requiring confirmation
- Both must be resolved before review completion or have accepted closure plans
