## 1. Introduction

This document specifies requirements for a Telemetry Data Processing System (TDPS) as a test artifact for validating orchestration sequential chain patterns.

---

## 2. Requirements

### REQ-TEST-TDP-001: Data Ingestion Rate

**Requirement:** The system SHALL ingest telemetry data at a minimum rate of 1000 samples per second.

**Rationale:** Mission-critical telemetry requires high-throughput ingestion to prevent data loss during peak transmission windows.

**Verification Method:** Test

---

### REQ-TEST-TDP-002: Data Validation

**Requirement:** The system SHALL validate all incoming telemetry packets against the defined schema within 10 milliseconds of receipt.

**Rationale:** Early validation prevents corrupted data from propagating through the processing pipeline, reducing downstream error handling complexity.

**Verification Method:** Demonstration

---

### REQ-TEST-TDP-003: Anomaly Detection

**Requirement:** The system SHALL detect and flag anomalous telemetry values that deviate more than 3 standard deviations from the rolling baseline within 100 milliseconds.

**Rationale:** Rapid anomaly detection enables timely operator intervention for potential spacecraft system failures.

**Verification Method:** Test

---

### REQ-TEST-TDP-004: Data Persistence

**Requirement:** The system SHALL persist all validated telemetry data to long-term storage with 99.99% durability guarantee.

**Rationale:** Telemetry data is irreplaceable mission evidence required for post-mission analysis and anomaly investigation.

**Verification Method:** Analysis

---

### REQ-TEST-TDP-005: Query Response Time

**Requirement:** The system SHALL respond to telemetry queries spanning up to 24 hours of data within 5 seconds.

**Rationale:** Operators require rapid access to historical data during real-time mission operations for trend analysis and decision support.

**Verification Method:** Test

---

## 3. Traceability Matrix

| Requirement ID | Parent Requirement | Verification |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| REQ-TEST-TDP-001 | SYS-001 (System Performance) | Test |
| REQ-TEST-TDP-002 | SYS-002 (Data Integrity) | Demonstration |
| REQ-TEST-TDP-003 | SYS-003 (Fault Detection) | Test |
| REQ-TEST-TDP-004 | SYS-004 (Data Retention) | Analysis |
| REQ-TEST-TDP-005 | SYS-005 (Operator Support) | Test |

---

## 4. Summary

This specification defines 5 functional requirements for a Telemetry Data Processing System:
- **Performance:** High-throughput ingestion (REQ-001), fast query response (REQ-005)
- **Reliability:** Data validation (REQ-002), persistence durability (REQ-004)
- **Safety:** Anomaly detection (REQ-003)

These requirements provide input for downstream architecture and verification agents in the sequential chain validation.
