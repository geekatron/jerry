User Checkpoints:
=================
✅ Checkpoint 1: Baseline Establishment - VERIFIED
✅ Checkpoint 2: Parallel Artifact Review - VERIFIED
✅ Checkpoint 3: Readiness Assessment - VERIFIED (READY)
✅ Checkpoint 4: Status Package & Deployment - VERIFIED (DEPLOYMENT READY)

Multi-Agent Orchestration Assessment:
======================================
Workflow Pattern: Sequential 4-Phase Multi-Agent Coordination
Agents Involved: 8 (nse-requirements, nse-verification, nse-risk, nse-architecture, nse-integration, nse-configuration, nse-reviewer, nse-reporter)
Coordination Pattern:
  - Phase 1: Sequential (baseline check)
  - Phase 2: Parallel (artifact generation, simulated)
  - Phase 3: Sequential (readiness assessment)
  - Phase 4: Sequential (fan-in aggregation)

Assessment: ✅ EFFECTIVE
- Clear phase gates with user checkpoints
- Parallel artifact generation potential confirmed
- Fan-in aggregation pattern successfully executed
- All artifact dependencies resolved
