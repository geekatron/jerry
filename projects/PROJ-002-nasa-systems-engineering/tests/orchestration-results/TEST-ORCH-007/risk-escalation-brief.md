## 1. Risk Identification

### Risk ID: R-001

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Title** | AI Hallucination of NASA Standards |
| **Risk Score** | **20** (Likelihood 4 × Consequence 5) |
| **Classification** | RED - CRITICAL |
| **Category** | Technical |
| **Status** | Active - Mitigations Implemented |
| **Owner** | User (SME) |
| **Date Identified** | 2026-01-09 |
| **Escalation Triggered** | 2026-01-10 |

---

## 2. Risk Statement

### IF-THEN Format (NPR 8000.4C Compliant)

> **IF** the AI generates inaccurate interpretations of NASA standards (NPR 7123.1D, NPR 8000.4C),
>
> **THEN** users may apply incorrect SE practices,
>
> **RESULTING IN** non-compliant SE artifacts and potential mission risk.

---

## 3. Risk Scoring Justification

### Likelihood Assessment: 4 (Likely)

| Factor | Assessment | Evidence |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Historical Precedent | High | LLMs are documented to confidently produce plausible-sounding but incorrect information |
| Technical Basis | High | Model training data may contain outdated or incorrect interpretations of standards |
| Control Effectiveness | Moderate | Current mitigations reduce but do not eliminate likelihood |
| Probability Range | 50-75% | Without human validation, hallucination is probable |

### Consequence Assessment: 5 (Critical)

| Impact Area | Severity | Rationale |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Technical** | Critical | Incorrect SE guidance could propagate through entire system design |
| **Safety** | Critical | Mission-critical decisions based on hallucinated guidance could endanger personnel/mission |
| **Schedule** | Major | Discovery of incorrect guidance late in lifecycle causes significant rework |
| **Cost** | Major | Rework costs compound across lifecycle phases |

### Risk Matrix Position

```
        CONSEQUENCE
        1       2       3       4       5
    5 |       |       |       |       |       |
    4 |       |       |       |       | R-001 |  <-- CURRENT POSITION
L   3 |       |       |       |       |       |
    2 |       |       |       |       |       |
    1 |       |       |       |       |       |
                                        ↑
                                   CRITICAL ZONE
```

## 4. Impact Analysis

### Affected Requirements

| Requirement ID | Title | Impact if Risk Materializes |
|----------------|-------|---------------------------|
| REQ-NSE-SYS-002 | Process Coverage | All 17 process outputs potentially compromised |
| REQ-NSE-SYS-004 | AI Disclaimer | Disclaimer may be insufficient warning |
| REQ-NSE-FUN-001 | Requirements Generation | Generated requirements may be non-compliant |
| REQ-NSE-FUN-003 | Risk Assessment | Risk guidance itself may be incorrect |

### Downstream Effects

## 5. Current Mitigation Status

### Implemented Mitigations

| # | Mitigation Action | Status | Effectiveness |
|---|-------------------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | P-043 mandatory disclaimer on all outputs | COMPLETE | Reduces consequence through awareness |
| 2 | User designated as SME proxy for validation | COMPLETE | Reduces likelihood through human review |
| 3 | Citations to authoritative sources | COMPLETE | Enables verification of claims |
| 4 | Human-in-loop gate checkpoints | COMPLETE | 6 phase gates with user approval |

### Residual Risk After Mitigation

| Factor | Pre-Mitigation | Post-Mitigation | Change |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Likelihood | 4 (Likely) | 2 (Unlikely) | -2 |
| Consequence | 5 (Critical) | 4 (Major) | -1 |
| **Score** | **20 (RED)** | **8 (YELLOW)** | -12 |

---

## 6. Urgency Indicators

### Why This Requires Immediate Attention

| Indicator | Status | Implication |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Raw Score >= 16 | YES | Automatic escalation per NPR 8000.4C |
| Safety Impact | HIGH | Potential for safety-critical misuse |
| Propagation Risk | HIGH | Errors compound across lifecycle |
| Detection Difficulty | MEDIUM | Hallucinations can be subtle and convincing |
| Mitigation Feasibility | HIGH | Actions can reduce risk to acceptable level |

### Time Sensitivity

```
URGENCY LEVEL: HIGH
├── Reason: Risk is inherent to AI-generated guidance
├── Window: Continuous (not event-driven)
└── Action Required: User validation BEFORE using any SE outputs
```

## 8. Escalation Path

### Current Escalation Status

```
[✓] Risk identified and documented (2026-01-09)
[✓] Score calculated as RED (Score: 20)
[✓] Mitigations implemented
[✓] Residual risk assessed (Score: 8 - YELLOW)
[✓] User escalation brief generated (This document)
[→] AWAITING: User acknowledgment and validation
[ ] User validation of mitigation effectiveness
[ ] Risk acceptance or additional mitigation decision
```

### Next Escalation Threshold

If mitigations prove ineffective:
- **Threshold:** Residual risk remains >= 16
- **Action:** Tool restriction or capability removal
- **Authority:** User decision required
