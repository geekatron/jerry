# WI-SAO-046: External Research - Context7 + Anthropic Docs

> **Status:** 📋 OPEN
> **Priority:** P1 (Phase 1 Research)
> **Pipeline Pattern:** Pattern 3 (Fan-Out) - Parallel Research Track A

---

## Description

Gather latest best practices from Context7 Claude Code documentation and Anthropic research on context engineering, agent design, and prompting strategies. This is one of three parallel research tracks that feed into the synthesis barrier (WI-SAO-049).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [ ] ≥3 Context7 queries completed with documented results
2. [ ] ≥5 web search results synthesized
3. [ ] Research document created with proper citations
4. [ ] Key findings extracted for enhancement rubric
