## Objective

Serve as the home for future-facing features, research initiatives, and advanced capabilities that emerged during PROJ-001 (OSS Release) but fall outside its release scope. These items require further research, infrastructure that doesn't yet exist, or exploration before they can be implemented.

## Scope

- Advanced adversarial capabilities requiring cross-model LLM infrastructure (migrated from PROJ-001 EPIC-004)
- Research-heavy features that need exploration before commitment
- Infrastructure prerequisites identified during PROJ-001 work
- Future enhancements to the Jerry framework beyond the initial OSS release

**Out of scope:**
- OSS release preparation (remains in PROJ-001)
- Bug fixes and maintenance for current release (remains in PROJ-001)

## Origin

Created 2026-02-17 by migrating EPIC-004 (Advanced Adversarial Capabilities) from PROJ-001. PROJ-001 is focused on OSS release preparation; future-facing R&D items needed a dedicated project with appropriate scope and planning space.

## Phases

*To be decomposed via /worktracker as research matures.*

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All migrated work items have correct references and parent pointers
- [ ] Research epics produce actionable findings with clear go/no-go decisions
- [ ] Infrastructure prerequisites are documented with dependency tracking
- [ ] Implemented features meet quality gate (>= 0.92) per quality-enforcement.md
