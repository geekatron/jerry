## Content

### Description

Conduct a systematic literature review of context-based selection algorithms and heuristics applicable to adversarial strategy selection. This task surveys recommendation system literature (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approaches) as applied to process and workflow selection, prioritizing sources from ACM, IEEE, and established textbooks such as Ricci et al., "Recommender Systems Handbook." The output is a research artifact with at least 5 authoritative citations documenting applicable selection mechanisms.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Literature review covers context-based selection algorithms with at least 5 authoritative citations
- [ ] All citations include DOI, ISBN, or verifiable publication reference
- [ ] Research artifact persisted to filesystem under EN-601 directory
- [ ] Discoveries captured as DISC entities during research
- [ ] Task characteristic taxonomy dimensions identified (type, complexity, domain, risk)

### Implementation Notes

- Prioritize sources from ACM, IEEE, and established textbooks
- Focus on recommendation system architectures applicable to review strategy matching
- Include context-based routing and adaptive review process patterns
- This task can run in parallel with TASK-002 and TASK-003
