## Content

### Description

Survey existing adaptive review and inspection systems from software engineering, intelligence analysis, and AI safety. Research Fagan inspection variants, risk-based testing strategies, structured analytic technique selection frameworks from Heuer and Pherson, and constitutional AI strategy routing and RLHF critic selection approaches. The survey must identify at least 3 existing adaptive review systems with documented outcomes and extract applicable patterns for Jerry's strategy selection.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Survey identifies at least 3 existing adaptive review systems with documented outcomes
- [ ] Coverage includes software engineering, intelligence analysis, and AI safety domains
- [ ] All citations include DOI, ISBN, or verifiable publication reference
- [ ] Research artifact persisted to filesystem under EN-601 directory
- [ ] Discoveries captured as DISC entities during research

### Implementation Notes

- Draw from multiple domains: software engineering, intelligence analysis, AI safety
- Focus on systems that demonstrate adaptive selection based on context
- Document outcomes and effectiveness data for each system surveyed
- This task can run in parallel with TASK-001 and TASK-002
