## Summary

Research multi-agent architecture patterns from Google ADK, LangChain, Microsoft, OpenAI, CrewAI, and Anthropic to inform Jerry's agent organization strategy.

---

## Tasks

- [x] Research Google Agent Development Kit patterns
- [x] Research LangChain/LangGraph patterns
- [x] Research Microsoft AutoGen patterns
- [x] Research OpenAI Swarm patterns
- [x] Research AGENTS.md convention
- [x] Synthesize recommendations for Jerry

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Multi-agent patterns from 5+ frameworks documented
- [x] AGENTS.md convention documented (60,000+ projects)
- [x] Hybrid architecture recommendation formed
- [x] Agent registry patterns documented
- [x] Sources cited with URLs

## Verification Evidence

### Output Artifact
- **File**: `research/proj-003-e-003-architecture-patterns.md`
- **Lines**: ~450
- **Date**: 2026-01-12

### Sources Cited (20)
1. Google Agent Development Kit
2. LangChain/LangGraph documentation
3. Microsoft AutoGen
4. OpenAI Swarm
5. CrewAI
6. Anthropic multi-agent research
7. AGENTS.md GitHub topic

### Key Finding: DISC-001
**Hybrid agent organization is industry-aligned**
- General agents in `.claude/agents/`
- Skill-specific agents in `skills/{skill}/agents/`
- This is Jerry's current pattern - no reorganization needed!

## Relationships

| Type | ID | Description |
|------|----|-------------|
| blocks | wi-00-005 | Gap analysis depends on this |
| blocks | wi-00-006 | Synthesis depends on this |
| discovery | DISC-001 | Hybrid org is correct |
| informs | wi-05-001 | Registry patterns |

## Notes

Key insight: Jerry's hybrid agent organization is already aligned with industry best practices. The cleanup is about metadata and configuration, not file reorganization.
