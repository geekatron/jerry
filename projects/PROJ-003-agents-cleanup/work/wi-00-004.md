## Summary

Extract relevant knowledge from PROJ-001-plugin-cleanup that applies to the current agent/skill cleanup effort, including design decisions, templates, and patterns.

---

## Tasks

- [x] Review PROJ-001 synthesis documents
- [x] Extract agent organization decisions
- [x] Document PS_AGENT_TEMPLATE pattern
- [x] Identify scope clarification (in/out of scope)
- [x] Document constitutional compliance requirements

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Agent location decisions documented
- [x] Template patterns extracted
- [x] Cleanup scope clarified (what to include/exclude)
- [x] Constitutional principles identified
- [x] Design canon references included

---

## Verification Evidence

### Output Artifact
- **File**: `analysis/proj-003-e-004-proj001-knowledge.md`
- **Lines**: ~420
- **Date**: 2026-01-12

### Sources Referenced
1. PROJ-001 synthesis documents
2. PS_AGENT_TEMPLATE.md
3. Jerry Design Canon
4. Jerry Constitution v1.0

### Key Finding: DISC-002
**ps-* agents are already compliant**
- Have proper YAML frontmatter
- Follow PS_AGENT_TEMPLATE structure
- Only framework agents need updates

### Scope Clarification
**IN SCOPE:**
- Verify agent file structure
- Check for duplicates
- Ensure canonical template compliance
- Update AGENTS.md registry

**OUT OF SCOPE:**
- Creating worktracker agents (greenfield)
- Restructuring CLAUDE.md
- Creating PLAYBOOK.md

## Relationships

| Type | ID | Description |
|------|----|-------------|
| blocks | wi-00-005 | Gap analysis depends on this |
| blocks | wi-00-006 | Synthesis depends on this |
| discovery | DISC-002 | ps-* agents compliant |
| informs | wi-03-001 | Framework agent updates |

---

## Notes

Internal knowledge extraction from PROJ-001. Key insight is that ps-* agents are already well-structured - only the 3 framework agents need frontmatter updates.
