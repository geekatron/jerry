## Summary

Comprehensive gap analysis comparing Jerry's current agent/skill structure against industry best practices identified in research documents proj-003-e-001 through e-004.

---

## Tasks

- [x] Read all research documents (e-001 through e-004)
- [x] Examine current Jerry structure
- [x] Identify gaps by category
- [x] Assign severity and priority
- [x] Create remediation roadmap

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All gaps identified with IDs (GAP-XXX)
- [x] Each gap has severity (High/Medium/Low)
- [x] Each gap has priority (Immediate/Short-term/Long-term)
- [x] Remediation steps documented
- [x] Impact assessment included

## Verification Evidence

### Output Artifact
- **File**: `analysis/proj-003-e-005-gap-analysis.md`
- **Lines**: ~436
- **Date**: 2026-01-12

### Gap Summary
| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| High | 6 |
| Medium | 10 |
| Low | 7 |
| **Total** | **23** |

### High Severity Gaps
- GAP-001: Commands in wrong location
- GAP-002: Plugin manifest non-standard
- GAP-006: worktracker SKILL.md missing frontmatter
- GAP-007: architecture SKILL.md missing frontmatter
- GAP-008: worktracker-decomposition SKILL.md missing frontmatter

### Positive Findings
- No deprecated patterns detected
- Hybrid agent organization is correct
- ps-* agents are already compliant

## Notes

23 gaps identified but no agent reorganization required. The gaps are in metadata and configuration, not file structure.
