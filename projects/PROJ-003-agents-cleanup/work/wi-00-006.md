- [x] Define migration sequence (5 phases)
- [x] Document success criteria

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All source documents referenced
- [x] Key takeaways from each document
- [x] Extracted patterns (directory, SKILL.md, agent, hook)
- [x] Decision matrix with actions per component
- [x] Migration sequence with phases
- [x] Success criteria checklist
