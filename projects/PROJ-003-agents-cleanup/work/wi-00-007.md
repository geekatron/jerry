## Summary

Create Architecture Decision Record (ADR) documenting the agent and skill cleanup migration strategy based on synthesis findings.

---

## Tasks

- [x] Read synthesis document (e-006)
- [x] Document context and problem statement
- [x] Document decision with rationale
- [x] Document alternatives considered
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] Document consequences and risks
- [x] Define validation criteria

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ADR follows Jerry ADR template
- [x] All decisions traceable to synthesis
- [x] Alternatives documented with rejection rationale
- [x] Implementation plan matches synthesis phases
- [x] Rollback plan included

---

## Verification Evidence

### Output Artifact
- **File**: `decisions/ADR-PROJ003-001-agent-skill-cleanup-strategy.md`
- **Lines**: 520
- **Date**: 2026-01-12

### ADR Sections
1. Context (problem, current state, research, constraints)
2. Decision (core decision, rationale, alternatives)
3. Implementation Plan (5 phases)
4. Consequences (positive, negative, risks)
5. Validation (success criteria, rollback)

### Decision Summary
**Selected Option:** Hybrid with Standardization
- Preserve hybrid agent organization
- Standardize plugin structure
- Add YAML frontmatter to skills/agents
- Complete AGENTS.md registry

### Rejected Alternatives
- Option A: Centralized - breaks encapsulation
- Option B: Distributed - framework agents are cross-cutting
- Option C: Status Quo - high-severity gaps unresolved

## Notes

ADR is ready for user approval. Status is "Proposed" - will change to "Accepted" after approval.
