## Summary

Create `commands/` directory at plugin root and move command files from `.claude/commands/` to the new location per canonical structure.

---

## Tasks

- [ ] Create `commands/` directory at plugin root
- [ ] Move `.claude/commands/architect.md` to `commands/architect.md`
- [ ] Move `.claude/commands/release.md` to `commands/release.md`
- [ ] Verify moved files retain correct content
- [ ] Test `/architect` command works from new location
- [ ] Test `/release` command works from new location
- [ ] Remove empty `.claude/commands/` directory

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Directory `commands/` exists at plugin root
- [ ] File `commands/architect.md` exists and is valid
- [ ] File `commands/release.md` exists and is valid
- [ ] Commands `/architect` and `/release` invoke correctly
- [ ] Directory `.claude/commands/` does NOT exist

---

## Verification Evidence

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Commands directory exists at root
test -d commands && echo "OK"

# Command files exist
test -f commands/architect.md && test -f commands/release.md && echo "OK"

# Old location removed
test ! -d .claude/commands && echo "OK"
```

### Output Artifacts
- **Directory**: `commands/`
- **Files**: `commands/architect.md`, `commands/release.md`

### Source Reference
- proj-003-e-001: Canonical plugin structure
- GAP-001: Commands in wrong location

## Relationships

| Type | ID | Description |
|------|----|-------------|
| depends_on | wi-01-002 | Plugin.json must reference new paths |
| blocks | wi-01-004 | Cleanup requires moves complete |
| related_to | GAP-001 | Addresses commands location gap |

---

## Notes

Move files one at a time, test immediately per ADR risk mitigation strategy.
