## Summary

Final cleanup and validation of Phase 1 plugin infrastructure changes. Ensure all paths are correct and plugin loads successfully.

## Tasks

- [ ] Verify plugin.json paths match actual file locations
- [ ] Remove any empty directories from migration
- [ ] Run full plugin validation with `claude-code --debug`
- [ ] Document any issues encountered during migration
- [ ] Create git commit for Phase 1 completion
- [ ] Tag commit with phase marker

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Plugin loads without errors in Claude Code
- [ ] All commands listed in plugin.json are accessible
- [ ] No orphaned or empty directories remain
- [ ] Git commit created with all Phase 1 changes
- [ ] Phase 1 success criteria from ADR satisfied

---

## Verification Evidence

### ADR Success Criteria (Phase 1)
- [ ] `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exists (not `manifest.json`)
- [ ] `plugin.json` uses standard Anthropic schema
- [ ] `commands/` directory at root with `architect.md`, `release.md`
- [ ] `.claude/commands/` directory removed

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Full validation sequence
test -f .claude-plugin/plugin.json && \
test ! -f .claude-plugin/manifest.json && \
test -d commands && \
test -f commands/architect.md && \
test -f commands/release.md && \
test ! -d .claude/commands && \
echo "Phase 1: COMPLETE"
```
