## Verification Evidence

### Expected Frontmatter

---
name: architecture
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "design system",
  "create ADR", "review architecture", or mentions architectural decisions.
version: 1.0.0
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Grep
  - Glob
---
```

### Validation Commands
```bash
# File starts with frontmatter
head -1 skills/architecture/SKILL.md | grep -q "^---" && echo "OK"

# YAML is valid
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('skills/architecture/SKILL.md').read().split('---')[1])"
```

### Output Artifact
- **File**: `skills/architecture/SKILL.md` (modified)
