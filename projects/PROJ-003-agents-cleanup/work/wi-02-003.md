## Verification Evidence

### Expected Frontmatter
```yaml

description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "decompose task",
  "break down work", "create subtasks", or mentions task breakdown.
version: 1.0.0
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
---
```

### Validation Commands
```bash
# File starts with frontmatter
head -1 skills/worktracker-decomposition/SKILL.md | grep -q "^---" && echo "OK"

# YAML is valid
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('skills/worktracker-decomposition/SKILL.md').read().split('---')[1])"
```

### Output Artifact
- **File**: `skills/worktracker-decomposition/SKILL.md` (modified)
