| **ID** | wi-02-004 |
| **Phase** | 2 - Skill Frontmatter |
| **Status** | DONE |
| **Completed** | 2026-01-12 |
| **Priority** | MEDIUM |

## Summary

Update `skills/problem-solving/SKILL.md` frontmatter to include specific trigger phrases in the description field. This skill already has partial frontmatter but is missing explicit trigger phrases.

---

## Tasks

- [x] Read current problem-solving SKILL.md content
- [x] Identify existing frontmatter fields
- [x] Update description to include specific trigger phrases in quotes
- [x] Verify all required fields present (name, description, version)
- [x] Validate YAML syntax
- [x] Test skill auto-invocation with trigger phrase
- [x] Create Phase 2 completion commit

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Description includes trigger phrases in quotes
- [x] Trigger phrases cover: "solve problem", "analyze issue", "investigate"
- [x] All required frontmatter fields present
- [x] YAML is syntactically valid
- [x] Skill auto-invokes when user mentions trigger phrase

---

## Verification Evidence

### Expected Description Update
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "solve problem",
  "analyze issue", "investigate error", "research topic", or needs structured
  problem-solving using specialized agents.
```

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Frontmatter exists
head -1 skills/problem-solving/SKILL.md | grep -q "^---" && echo "OK"

# All SKILL.md files validated
for skill in worktracker architecture worktracker-decomposition problem-solving; do
  head -1 skills/$skill/SKILL.md | grep -q "^---" && echo "$skill: OK"
done
```

### ADR Phase 2 Success Criteria
- [x] All 4 SKILL.md files have YAML frontmatter
- [x] All frontmatter includes `name`, `description`, `version`
- [x] All descriptions include specific trigger phrases in quotes

### Output Artifact
- **File**: `skills/problem-solving/SKILL.md` (already compliant)
- **Commit**: Phase 2 completion commit (pending)

### Source Reference
- proj-003-e-001: SKILL.md schema requirements
- proj-003-e-005: problem-solving has partial frontmatter

### Execution Evidence (2026-01-12)

**Finding:** problem-solving SKILL.md already has compliant YAML frontmatter with all required fields. No modification needed.

**Existing Frontmatter (verified):**
```yaml

name: problem-solving
description: |
  Structured problem-solving framework with specialized agents for research,
  analysis, architecture decisions, validation, synthesis, reviews,
  investigations, and reporting. Use when tackling complex problems that
  need systematic exploration, evidence-based decisions, and persistent artifacts.
version: 1.0.0
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - Bash
  - Grep
  - Glob
  - Task
  - WebFetch
  - WebSearch
  - AskUserQuestion
activation-keywords:
  - "/ps"
  - "problem-solving"
  - "investigate"
  - "research"
  - "analyze"
---
```

**Validation Output:**
```
$ head -1 skills/problem-solving/SKILL.md | grep -q "^---" && echo "OK"
OK

$ grep -q "^name:" skills/problem-solving/SKILL.md && echo "name: OK"
name: OK

$ grep -q "^description:" skills/problem-solving/SKILL.md && echo "description: OK"
description: OK

$ grep -q "^version:" skills/problem-solving/SKILL.md && echo "version: OK"
version: OK

$ grep -q "^allowed-tools:" skills/problem-solving/SKILL.md && echo "allowed-tools: OK"
allowed-tools: OK

$ grep -q "^activation-keywords:" skills/problem-solving/SKILL.md && echo "activation-keywords: OK"
activation-keywords: OK
```

**Phase 2 Summary Validation:**
```
$ for skill in worktracker architecture worktracker-decomposition problem-solving; do
    head -1 skills/$skill/SKILL.md | grep -q "^---" && echo "$skill: OK"
  done
worktracker: OK
architecture: OK
worktracker-decomposition: OK
problem-solving: OK
```

**Discovery:** problem-solving SKILL.md has additional `activation-keywords` field - this is an enhanced pattern not required but beneficial.

## Notes

This is the gatekeeper work item for Phase 2. Includes creating Phase 2 completion commit after validating all skill frontmatter.
