## Verification Evidence

### Expected Frontmatter
```yaml
---

model: claude-opus-4-5
color: purple
tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - Glob
  - Grep
  - Task
---
```

### Validation Commands
```bash
# File starts with frontmatter
head -1 .claude/agents/orchestrator.md | grep -q "^---" && echo "OK"

# Has required fields
grep -q "^name:" .claude/agents/orchestrator.md && echo "name: OK"
grep -q "^model:" .claude/agents/orchestrator.md && echo "model: OK"
grep -q "^tools:" .claude/agents/orchestrator.md && echo "tools: OK"
```

### Output Artifact
