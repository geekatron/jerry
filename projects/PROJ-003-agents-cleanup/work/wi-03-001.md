## Verification Evidence

### Expected Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: orchestrator
description: Use this agent when the user asks to "coordinate complex tasks",
  "decompose work", "delegate to specialists".
  <example>User: "Help me implement authentication across multiple files"</example>
  <example>User: "Coordinate a refactoring effort"</example>
model: claude-opus-4-5
color: purple
tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - Glob
  - Grep
  - Task
---
```

### Validation Commands
```bash
# File starts with frontmatter
head -1 .claude/agents/orchestrator.md | grep -q "^---" && echo "OK"

# Has required fields
grep -q "^name:" .claude/agents/orchestrator.md && echo "name: OK"
grep -q "^model:" .claude/agents/orchestrator.md && echo "model: OK"
grep -q "^tools:" .claude/agents/orchestrator.md && echo "tools: OK"
```

### Output Artifact
- **File**: `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` (modified)

### Source Reference
- proj-003-e-001: Agent definition schema
- proj-003-e-004: PROJ-001 knowledge (PS_AGENT_TEMPLATE pattern)

### Execution Evidence (2026-01-12)

**Frontmatter Added:**
```yaml
---
name: orchestrator
description: |
  Use this agent when the user asks to "coordinate complex tasks",
  "decompose work", "delegate to specialists", or needs multi-step orchestration.
  <example>User: "Help me implement authentication across multiple files"</example>
  <example>User: "Coordinate a refactoring effort across the codebase"</example>
  <example>User: "Break down this feature into subtasks and delegate"</example>
model: claude-opus-4-5
color: purple
tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - Glob
  - Grep
  - Task
