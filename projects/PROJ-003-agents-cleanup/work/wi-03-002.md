## Verification Evidence

### Expected Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: qa-engineer
description: Use this agent when the user asks to "write tests",
  "review test coverage", "design test strategy".
  <example>User: "Write unit tests for this module"</example>
  <example>User: "Review the test coverage for authentication"</example>
model: inherit
color: green
tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - Bash
  - Grep
---
```

### Validation Commands
```bash
# File starts with frontmatter
head -1 .claude/agents/qa-engineer.md | grep -q "^---" && echo "OK"

# Has required fields
grep -q "^name:" .claude/agents/qa-engineer.md && echo "name: OK"
grep -q "^model:" .claude/agents/qa-engineer.md && echo "model: OK"
grep -q "^tools:" .claude/agents/qa-engineer.md && echo "tools: OK"
```

### Output Artifact
- **File**: `.claude/agents/qa-engineer.md` (modified)

### Source Reference
- proj-003-e-001: Agent definition schema
- proj-003-e-004: PROJ-001 knowledge (PS_AGENT_TEMPLATE pattern)

### Execution Evidence (2026-01-12)

**Frontmatter Added:**
```yaml
---
name: qa-engineer
description: |
  Use this agent when the user asks to "write tests", "review test coverage",
  "design test strategy", or needs quality assurance expertise.
  <example>User: "Write unit tests for this module"</example>
  <example>User: "Review the test coverage for authentication"</example>
  <example>User: "Design a test strategy for this feature"</example>
model: inherit
color: green
tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - Bash
  - Grep

```

**Validation Output:**
```
=== qa-engineer ===

## Notes

QA engineer focuses on testing. Needs Bash for running tests. Uses green color for test association.
