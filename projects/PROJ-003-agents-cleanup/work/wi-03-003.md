- [x] Frontmatter includes `name: security-auditor`
- [x] Frontmatter includes `description` with 2+ `<example>` blocks
- [x] Frontmatter includes `model: inherit`
- [x] Frontmatter includes `color: red`
- [x] Frontmatter includes `tools` list (read-only focus)
- [x] YAML is syntactically valid

## Verification Evidence

### Expected Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: security-auditor
description: Use this agent when the user asks to "security review",
  "audit vulnerabilities", "check for security issues".
  <example>User: "Review this code for security vulnerabilities"</example>
  <example>User: "Audit the authentication implementation"</example>
model: inherit
color: red
tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Glob
---
```

### Validation Commands
```bash
# File starts with frontmatter
head -1 .claude/agents/security-auditor.md | grep -q "^---" && echo "OK"

# Has required fields
grep -q "^name:" .claude/agents/security-auditor.md && echo "name: OK"
grep -q "^model:" .claude/agents/security-auditor.md && echo "model: OK"
grep -q "^tools:" .claude/agents/security-auditor.md && echo "tools: OK"
```

### Output Artifact
- **File**: `.claude/agents/security-auditor.md` (modified)

### Source Reference
- proj-003-e-001: Agent definition schema
- proj-003-e-004: PROJ-001 knowledge (PS_AGENT_TEMPLATE pattern)

### Execution Evidence (2026-01-12)

**Frontmatter Added:**
```yaml
---
name: security-auditor
description: |
  Use this agent when the user asks to "security review", "audit vulnerabilities",
  "check for security issues", or needs OWASP-based security analysis.
  <example>User: "Review this code for security vulnerabilities"</example>
  <example>User: "Audit the authentication implementation"</example>
  <example>User: "Check for OWASP Top 10 issues in this module"</example>
model: inherit
color: red
tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Glob
---
```

**Validation Output:**
```
=== security-auditor ===
[OK] Starts with ---
[OK] name field present
[OK] description field present
[OK] model field present
[OK] color field present
[OK] tools field present
[OK] 3 <example> blocks found
```

## Notes

Security auditor uses read-only tools (Read, Grep, Glob) for principle of least privilege. Red color indicates security/warning focus.
