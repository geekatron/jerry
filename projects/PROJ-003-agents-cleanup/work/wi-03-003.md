## Summary

Add YAML frontmatter to `.claude/agents/security-auditor.md` with name, description (including example invocations), model, color, and tools per Claude Code agent schema.

---

## Tasks

- [ ] Read current security-auditor.md content
- [ ] Create YAML frontmatter block with required fields
- [ ] Include 2-4 `<example>` blocks in description
- [ ] Define tools list for security review (read-only preferred)
- [ ] Set model to `inherit` (uses parent model)
- [ ] Set color to `red`
- [ ] Prepend frontmatter to existing content
- [ ] Validate YAML syntax

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Agent file starts with `---` YAML delimiter
- [ ] Frontmatter includes `name: security-auditor`
- [ ] Frontmatter includes `description` with 2+ `<example>` blocks
- [ ] Frontmatter includes `model: inherit`
- [ ] Frontmatter includes `color: red`
- [ ] Frontmatter includes `tools` list (read-only focus)
- [ ] YAML is syntactically valid

---

## Verification Evidence

### Expected Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: security-auditor
description: Use this agent when the user asks to "security review",
  "audit vulnerabilities", "check for security issues".
  <example>User: "Review this code for security vulnerabilities"</example>
  <example>User: "Audit the authentication implementation"</example>
model: inherit
color: red
tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Glob
---
```

### Validation Commands
```bash
# File starts with frontmatter
head -1 .claude/agents/security-auditor.md | grep -q "^---" && echo "OK"

# Has required fields
grep -q "^name:" .claude/agents/security-auditor.md && echo "name: OK"
grep -q "^model:" .claude/agents/security-auditor.md && echo "model: OK"
grep -q "^tools:" .claude/agents/security-auditor.md && echo "tools: OK"
```

### Output Artifact
- **File**: `.claude/agents/security-auditor.md` (modified)

### Source Reference
- proj-003-e-001: Agent definition schema
- proj-003-e-004: PROJ-001 knowledge (PS_AGENT_TEMPLATE pattern)

## Relationships

| Type | ID | Description |
|------|----|-------------|
| depends_on | wi-02-004 | Phase 2 must be complete |
| parallel | wi-03-001 | Can be done in parallel |
| parallel | wi-03-002 | Can be done in parallel |
| informs | wi-03-004 | Template update uses this as example |

## Notes

Security auditor uses read-only tools (Read, Grep, Glob) for principle of least privilege. Red color indicates security/warning focus.
