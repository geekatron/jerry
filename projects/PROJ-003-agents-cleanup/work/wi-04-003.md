## Verification Evidence

### Git Status (2026-01-12)
```
D .claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py
D .claude/hooks/subagent_stop.py
?? scripts/pre_tool_use.py
?? scripts/subagent_stop.py
```

### Directory Verification
```bash
$ ls -la .claude/hooks/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Directory does not exist"
Directory does not exist

$ ls scripts/*.py
pre_tool_use.py
session_start.py
subagent_stop.py
```

### Validation Results (2026-01-12)
```
✓ .claude/hooks/ directory does not exist (deleted)
✓ scripts/ contains: pre_tool_use.py, session_start.py, subagent_stop.py
✓ hooks.json references ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/ paths
✓ SessionStart hook fires correctly from new location
```

### Output Artifacts
- **Deleted**: `.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py`
- **Deleted**: `.claude/hooks/subagent_stop.py`
- **Created**: `scripts/pre_tool_use.py`
- **Created**: `scripts/subagent_stop.py`
- **Kept**: `scripts/session_start.py` (already in correct location)

## Relationships

| Type | ID | Description |
|------|----|-------------|
| depends_on | wi-04-001 | Paths must use CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT |
| parallel | wi-04-002 | Can proceed in parallel |
| blocks | wi-04-004 | Cleanup depends on migration |

---

## Notes

Migration was completed prior to this session. The `.claude/hooks/` directory was deleted and scripts
were moved to `scripts/`. Verification confirmed all scripts are in the correct location and hooks.json
references the correct paths.
