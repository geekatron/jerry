## Relationships

| Type | ID | Description |
|------|----|-------------|
| depends_on | wi-04-001 | Paths must use CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT |
| parallel | wi-04-002 | Can proceed in parallel |
| blocks | wi-04-004 | Cleanup depends on migration |

---

## Notes

This may be a no-op if `.claude/hooks/` doesn't exist or is already empty. Still needs verification.
