## Summary

Expand `AGENTS.md` registry to include all 11 agents (3 framework + 8 ps-*) with accurate paths, scopes, and descriptions. This is the final phase completing the agent/skill cleanup migration.

---

## Tasks

- [x] Read current AGENTS.md content
- [x] Add Framework Agents section with paths:
  - orchestrator.md
  - qa-engineer.md
  - security-auditor.md
- [x] Add Skill-Specific Agents section with all 8 ps-* agents:
  - ps-researcher
  - ps-analyst
  - ps-synthesizer
  - ps-validator
  - ps-reporter
  - ps-architect
  - ps-reviewer
  - ps-investigator
- [x] Document agent scopes (global vs skill-local)
- [x] Verify all paths resolve to existing files (11/11 verified)
- [x] Create final completion commit for entire migration (f3b7a7f)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AGENTS.md lists all 11 agents
- [x] Each agent entry includes file path
- [x] Each agent entry includes brief description
- [x] Agent scopes documented (framework = global, ps-* = skill-local)
- [x] All paths in AGENTS.md resolve to existing files
- [x] Migration complete - all 5 phases done (f3b7a7f)
