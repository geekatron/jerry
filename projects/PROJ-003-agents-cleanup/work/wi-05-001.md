| Metadata | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **ID** | wi-05-001 |
| **Phase** | 5 - Registry Update |
| **Status** | PENDING |
| **Priority** | MEDIUM |
| **Created** | 2026-01-12 |

---

## Summary

Expand `AGENTS.md` registry to include all 11 agents (3 framework + 8 ps-*) with accurate paths, scopes, and descriptions. This is the final phase completing the agent/skill cleanup migration.

---

## Tasks

- [ ] Read current AGENTS.md content
- [ ] Add Framework Agents section with paths:
  - orchestrator.md
  - qa-engineer.md
  - security-auditor.md
- [ ] Add Skill-Specific Agents section with all 8 ps-* agents:
  - ps-researcher
  - ps-analyst
  - ps-synthesizer
  - ps-validator
  - ps-reporter
  - ps-architect
  - ps-reviewer
  - ps-investigator
- [ ] Document agent scopes (global vs skill-local)
- [ ] Verify all paths resolve to existing files
- [ ] Create final completion commit for entire migration

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AGENTS.md lists all 11 agents
- [ ] Each agent entry includes file path
- [ ] Each agent entry includes brief description
- [ ] Agent scopes documented (framework = global, ps-* = skill-local)
- [ ] All paths in AGENTS.md resolve to existing files
- [ ] Migration complete - all 5 phases done

## Verification Evidence

### Expected AGENTS.md Structure
```markdown
# AGENTS.md

## Framework Agents (Global)

| Agent | File | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Orchestrator | `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` | Coordinates complex tasks |
| QA Engineer | `.claude/agents/qa-engineer.md` | Test specialist |
| Security Auditor | `.claude/agents/security-auditor.md` | Security review |

## Skill-Specific Agents (problem-solving)

| Agent | File | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| ps-researcher | `skills/problem-solving/agents/ps-researcher.md` | Research tasks |
| ps-analyst | `skills/problem-solving/agents/ps-analyst.md` | Analysis tasks |
| ps-synthesizer | `skills/problem-solving/agents/ps-synthesizer.md` | Synthesis tasks |
| ps-validator | `skills/problem-solving/agents/ps-validator.md` | Validation tasks |
| ps-reporter | `skills/problem-solving/agents/ps-reporter.md` | Reporting tasks |
| ps-architect | `skills/problem-solving/agents/ps-architect.md` | Architecture decisions |
| ps-reviewer | `skills/problem-solving/agents/ps-reviewer.md` | Review tasks |
| ps-investigator | `skills/problem-solving/agents/ps-investigator.md` | Investigation tasks |
```

### Validation Commands
```bash
# AGENTS.md lists all agents (11+ references)
grep -c "\.md" AGENTS.md  # Should show 11+ agent references

# All paths exist
while read -r path; do
  test -f "$path" && echo "$path: OK"
done < <(grep -oE '\`.+\.md\`' AGENTS.md | tr -d '\`')
```

### ADR Phase 5 Success Criteria
- [ ] AGENTS.md lists all 11 agents with paths
- [ ] All paths in AGENTS.md resolve to existing files

### Migration Complete Checklist
- [ ] Phase 1: Plugin Infrastructure - DONE
- [ ] Phase 2: Skill Frontmatter - DONE
- [ ] Phase 3: Agent Standardization - DONE
- [ ] Phase 4: Hook System - DONE
- [ ] Phase 5: Registry Update - DONE

### Output Artifacts
- **File**: `AGENTS.md` (modified)
- **Commit**: Final migration completion commit

### Source Reference

## Relationships

| Type | ID | Description |
|------|----|-------------|
| depends_on | wi-04-004 | Phase 4 must be complete |
| depends_on | wi-03-004 | All agents must have frontmatter |
| completes | PROJ-003 | Final work item for migration |

---

## Notes

This is the final work item for PROJ-003-agents-cleanup. Upon completion:
1. All 23 gaps from gap analysis addressed
2. Jerry aligned with Claude Code industry standards
3. Plugin discovery, skill auto-invocation, and tool enforcement enabled

**Celebration milestone!**
