## Summary

Rewrite AGENTS.md to remove all Framework Agents references and focus only on skill-specific agents (ps-* agents in problem-solving skill).

---

## Tasks

- [x] Read current AGENTS.md
- [x] Remove "Framework Agents (Global)" section
- [x] Remove "Framework Agent Details" section (orchestrator, qa-engineer, security-auditor)
- [x] Update Agent Summary table to show only skill agents
- [x] Update Agent Philosophy to reference skill-based pattern
- [x] Update Agent Handoff Protocol example
- [x] Update "Adding New Agents" section for skill-based agents
- [x] Verify no `.claude/agents/` references remain

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AGENTS.md has no Framework Agents section
- [x] Agent Summary shows 8 agents (ps-* only)
- [x] No references to `.claude/agents/` paths
- [x] Adding New Agents points to `skills/{skill}/agents/`

---

## Verification Evidence

### Before State
- Agent Summary: 11 agents (3 framework + 8 skill)
- Framework Agents section with orchestrator, qa-engineer, security-auditor
- References to `.claude/agents/*.md`

### After State
- Agent Summary: 8 agents (skill-specific only)
- No Framework Agents section
- Verified: `grep -c '\.claude/agents/' AGENTS.md` returns 0

### Key Changes
1. Agent Philosophy: "conductor pattern" → "skill-based agent pattern"
2. Summary table: 11 → 8 agents
3. Handoff example: orchestrator/qa-engineer → ps-researcher/ps-analyst
4. Adding agents: `.claude/agents/` → `skills/{skill}/agents/`

### Source Reference
- User clarification: "The actual agents to use are in skills/ folder"
- Skill-based agents are the canonical architecture
