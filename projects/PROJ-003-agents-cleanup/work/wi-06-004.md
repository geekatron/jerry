## Verification Evidence

### Before State
```markdown
## Agents Available

See `AGENTS.md` for the full registry. Key agents:

| Agent | Role | File |
|-------|------|------|
| Orchestrator | Conductor (Opus 4.5) | `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` |
| QA Engineer | Test specialist | `.claude/agents/qa-engineer.md` |
| Security Auditor | Security review | `.claude/agents/security-auditor.md` |
```

### After State
```markdown
## Agents Available

See `AGENTS.md` for the full registry. Agents are scoped to skills:

| Skill | Agents | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| problem-solving | 8 specialists (researcher, analyst, synthesizer, etc.) | `skills/problem-solving/agents/` |

Invoke agents via the `/problem-solving` skill.
```

### Verification
- `grep -c '\.claude/agents/' CLAUDE.md` returns 0

### Source Reference
- Consistent with AGENTS.md update (wi-06-003)
- Skill-based agent invocation pattern
