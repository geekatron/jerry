|-----------|-------|
| Full name | Shane McConkey |
| Born | December 30, 1969, in San Francisco, California |
| Died | March 26, 2009, in the Dolomites, Italy |
| Nationality | Canadian-American (dual) |
| Cause of death | Ski BASE accident — parachute deployment failure during a ski BASE jump at Sass Pordoi, Dolomites |
| Primary sport | Freeskiing (alpine/big mountain) |
| Secondary discipline | Ski BASE jumping |
| Competitive career | World Extreme Skiing Championship winner (multiple times) |
| Home mountain | Squaw Valley (now Palisades Tahoe), Lake Tahoe, California |

### Timeline

| Period | Events |
|--------|--------|
| 1969 | Born in San Francisco. Raised partly in Canada (hence dual nationality). |
| Late 1980s | Emerges in competitive extreme skiing circuit. |
| Early 1990s | Begins appearing in ski films. Develops reputation as big-mountain standout. |
| Mid-1990s | Competitive dominance: multiple World Extreme Skiing Championship wins. Becomes known for combining technical precision with theatrical showmanship. |
| Late 1990s | Begins developing concepts for fat ski technology; frustration with conventional ski design leads to experimentation. |
| 2001 | Volant Spatula ski is released — the materialization of his fat-ski-with-reverse-camber concept. Considered a landmark moment in ski equipment history. |
| 2000s | Shifts from competitive to Matchstick Productions film career. Ski BASE jumping ascendancy. Saucer Boy character fully developed. |
| 2007–2009 | Peak of ski BASE work. Multiple films. Growing concern among peers about escalating risk. |
| March 2009 | Fatal ski BASE accident in the Dolomites during filming. Parachute did not deploy in time. |
| 2013 | "McConkey" documentary released by Matchstick Productions and others. Becomes definitive cinematic record of his life and influence. |

### Family

McConkey's daughter Ayla was born in 2005. His wife Sherry was present for major portions of his career. His death left Ayla fatherless at age three. The documentary gives significant weight to this dimension — he was fully aware of the risk he was taking and chose to continue. This duality (father who loved life + risk-taker at the extreme edge) is central to understanding his complexity.

---

## Personality Trait Taxonomy

The following traits are drawn from the documentary record, interview appearances, and descriptions by peers. Each is given an evidence basis.

### Primary Traits

| Trait | Description | Evidence |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Irreverent** | Instinctive refusal to defer to tradition, authority, or received wisdom. Expressed through costumes, comedy, and deliberate provocation of the ski establishment. | Raced in banana suits; skied in spandex onesie ("Saucer Boy"); challenged convention of narrow, stiff race skis when everyone said he was wrong. |
| **Technically precise** | Behind the comedy was meticulous study of physics, terrain, snow, and equipment. His innovations required deep understanding of ski mechanics. | Spatula design required understanding of reverse camber mechanics, flotation physics, and powder dynamics. Not intuition — analysis. |
| **Fearless (calibrated)** | Genuinely reduced fear, but not reckless. He trained, prepared, and escalated methodically. His fear threshold was simply set much higher than most humans. | Peer accounts universally note he was not suicidal or careless — he was extremely skilled and had thought through the risks, even if his risk tolerance was extreme. |
| **Generous** | Actively shared knowledge, time, and enthusiasm with other skiers. Did not hoard his innovations or position. | Multiple accounts of him helping other athletes, explaining the physics of what he was doing, welcoming newcomers. |
| **Joyful (infectious)** | His pleasure in what he was doing was visible, audible, and contagious. Couldn't watch him ski without smiling. | Film evidence: the grin mid-jump, the whoop mid-air. He performed joy. |
| **Community-oriented** | Understood skiing as a culture, not a career. Invested in the scene, the lifestyle, the people. | Squaw Valley community was central to his identity. He built community by being authentic. |
| **Theatrical** | Natural performer who understood spectacle. The Saucer Boy character was a constructed persona, deliberately outrageous, for effect. | The entire Saucer Boy conceit — spandex, name, skiing style — is a designed performance. |
| **Principled non-conformist** | Not rebellious for its own sake — rebelled in service of something better. The banana suit wasn't nihilism; it was making a point about fun. | He wasn't anti-ski. He loved skiing. His irreverence was in service of a vision of what skiing should be. |

### Secondary Traits

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Curious** | Driven to understand how things worked. Fat ski innovation came from asking "why do we accept these limitations?" |
| **Humorous (dry + physical)** | Deadpan delivery in interviews combined with slapstick physicality on snow. Two modes of comedy operating simultaneously. |
| **Ambitious** | Wanted to push further than anyone had. Not content with being the best at what existed — wanted to create new categories. |
| **Present-focused** | Accounts suggest he was intensely alive in the moment. Not dwelling on past or future. |
| **Quietly competitive** | The competitions mattered. Winning mattered. He just refused to show that through conventional seriousness. |

---

## The Innovation Record

### Fat Ski Revolution

McConkey's most lasting technical legacy. Conventional ski design in the 1990s optimized for hardpack, groomed runs, and racing: narrow, stiff, hard-cambered. For powder skiing, these skis were a limitation — they sank rather than floated.

McConkey's insight: dramatically widen the ski and introduce reverse camber (rocker) so it sits above the snow surface tip-and-tail while bending into the snow underfoot. This creates flotation without the skier having to maintain constant back-seat positioning to keep tips up.

The Volant Spatula (2001) was the commercial realization. The ski industry initially resisted — it looked absurd, violated every design norm, and was associated with a guy who skied in a costume. Within a decade, rockered skis were standard across the industry.

**The lesson for Jerry:** The best innovations look wrong before they look right. The costume obscured the genius until the genius was undeniable.

### Ski BASE Jumping

McConkey helped pioneer the discipline of ski BASE jumping — skiing off a cliff or drop and base jumping from the resulting trajectory. The technical challenge: ski release mechanisms must work mid-air, parachute deployment must be timed correctly, and body position must transition from skier to jumper in seconds.

He was not the only practitioner, but he was central to elevating it as a filmed discipline and pushing the complexity of lines attempted.

### Equipment Innovation Beyond Spatula

His equipment innovations extended beyond the Spatula. He experimented with binding systems, boot modifications, and other adaptations that allowed the ski-to-BASE transition. These are less documented publicly but indicate a consistent pattern: he encountered a limitation, studied it, and engineered a solution.

## The Performance Dimension

### The Saucer Boy Character

"Saucer Boy" was McConkey's most famous on-snow persona. The core elements:

- **Costume:** Spandex onesie, typically form-fitting and visually absurd
- **Persona name:** Derived from a saucer-shaped disc toy — playful, childlike
- **Skiing style:** Outrageous, theatrical, deliberately over-the-top
- **Effect on observers:** Impossible to watch without laughing, then being astonished

The character served multiple purposes simultaneously:
1. **Deflation of pomposity:** The ski film world had a tendency toward macho gravity. Saucer Boy was the counter-force.
2. **Amplifier of skill:** Because the context was so absurd, the actual skill stood out more starkly.
3. **Community invitation:** Humor is inclusive. The character invited people in rather than excluding them.
4. **Authentic expression:** This was not marketing — it was how McConkey actually was.

### Banana Suit Racing

Multiple accounts reference McConkey competing in serious competitions while wearing a banana suit. The detail that matters: he won. The suit was not an excuse for a joke performance — it was a statement that he could be both. Excellence and absurdity are not mutually exclusive.

### Matchstick Productions Films

Matchstick Productions was the primary vehicle for McConkey's film career. Key films include:

- **"Focused"** (2001) — early significant appearance
- **"Yearbook"** (2002)
- **"Claim"** (2003)
- **"Superheroes of Stoke"** (2006) — one of the most celebrated
- **"One for the Road"** (2009) — released after his death

The films collectively document his evolution from competitive skier to film star to ski BASE pioneer. The aesthetic of these films — big mountains, irreverent narration, a mix of genuine danger and comedy — is the visual grammar of the McConkey world.

### The "McConkey" Documentary (2013)

Produced by Matchstick Productions and Warren Miller Entertainment. Directed by Steven Rosenbaum. This documentary is the most important single source of McConkey lore. Key dimensions documented:

- Interview footage with McConkey himself (revealing his philosophical articulation of risk, fun, and living)
- Interviews with wife Sherry and peers
- Discussion of his relationship with his daughter Ayla
- His own awareness of the risks he was taking
- The accident reconstructed from available evidence

**Honesty note (P-022):** I cannot verify specific quotes from the documentary without direct access to the film. The philosophical position attributed to McConkey is drawn from the general documentary record and is representative of his known views, but specific verbatim quotes should be treated as [ATTRIBUTED] unless verifiable.

---

## Philosophy and Worldview

### Core Thesis: Fun and Excellence Are Multipliers, Not Trade-offs

The central philosophical claim of the McConkey life-as-evidence: you do not have to choose between being the best and having the most fun. In fact, the pursuit of genuine joy in what you do is correlated with, not opposed to, excellence. Fear of looking silly is the enemy of both.

This is not a naive claim. McConkey was disciplined, trained hard, and took his craft seriously. The point is that seriousness of purpose does not require seriousness of manner.

### Risk Philosophy

McConkey had a sophisticated relationship with risk. He was not reckless — he was deliberate. He understood that:
- Every meaningful thing carries risk
- The answer to risk is not avoidance but preparation, skill-building, and honest assessment
- Pretending risk doesn't exist is more dangerous than acknowledging and working with it

The shadow of this philosophy is the accident. He knew the risks and continued anyway. This is neither fully endorsed nor condemned here — it is noted as a dimension of the persona that the Jerry framework does not need to replicate. Jerry can draw on the joy-excellence synthesis without inheriting the mortality calculus.

### Community Philosophy

McConkey believed skiing was better when more people participated joyfully. His innovations democratized powder skiing — fat skis made powder accessible to intermediate skiers who couldn't manage traditional techniques. His performances made ski films more fun to watch. Both lowered barriers.

**Jerry parallel:** A framework that's enjoyable to work with lowers the barrier to adoption. Quality culture shouldn't be intimidating — it should be inviting.

### Authenticity

He did not perform a persona he didn't embody. The Saucer Boy character was an amplification of who he actually was, not a constructed mask over a different person. This authenticity was the source of his magnetism.

**Jerry implication:** The persona must be genuine to the framework's actual values, not a marketing overlay. If Jerry's quality gates are rigorous, the voice should celebrate rigor rather than apologize for it. The humor must emerge from real conviction, not be applied as a coating.

---

## McConkey to Jerry Framework Mapping

This expands the EPIC-001 principle table with additional depth and application specificity.

### Expanded Principle Table

| McConkey Principle | McConkey Expression | Jerry Application | Implementation Implication |
|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Joy + Excellence as multipliers** | Won in banana suit. Invented fat skis while grinning. | Quality gate >= 0.92 delivered with enthusiasm, not shame. | Error messages celebrate the attempt. Pass messages amplify the win. Neither is dry. |
| **Innovation looks wrong before it looks right** | Spatula ridiculed, then universal. | Jerry's architectural constraints (H-07 through H-10) look rigid until you see the stability they produce. | Voice can acknowledge "this might feel weird" while holding the line. Humor diffuses resistance. |
| **Never take yourself too seriously** | Skied in spandex. Named himself Saucer Boy. | Framework documentation shouldn't read like legal filings. | Tone: direct, confident, occasionally absurd. Not solemn. |
| **Technical precision is the foundation** | Best big-mountain skier alive; the comedy was built on bedrock competence. | The quality system (L1-L5, 0.92 threshold, S-014 rubric) is non-negotiable; how we talk about it is the variable. | Voice never undermines the system. It celebrates it differently. |
| **Community IS the point** | Built a movement, not just a career. Shared knowledge freely. | OSS Jerry isn't just code — it's a culture. The framework should feel like a community, not a compliance officer. | Session messages acknowledge the human on the other end. |
| **Costume optional but encouraged** | Banana suit. Saucer Boy onesie. | Jerry should have its own aesthetic. Recognizable, memorable, slightly absurd. | ASCII art, emoji philosophy, CLI personality — distinctive, not generic. |
| **Pushing limits is a practice, not an event** | Didn't jump once and retire. Kept escalating. | Quality framework is iterative by design (H-14: min 3 cycles). | Voice celebrates the loop, not just the destination. "Round 2. Let's go." |
| **Failures are data** | Equipment failures led to design improvements. | Quality gate FAIL messages are not verdicts, they are data. | "This didn't pass. Here's exactly why and what to fix." — not "REJECTED." |
| **The crowd matters** | His performances were for the audience, not just himself. | Developer experience is a real product. Humans feel the tool they use. | Voice imagines a person reading it. Not a parser consuming it. |
| **Authenticity is the only sustainable strategy** | Persona was amplification of self, not costume over a different person. | Jerry's voice must be genuine to the framework's actual values. | No ironic distance between the stated values and the communicated tone. |

## Voice Design Dimensions Analysis

### Tone

**Target:** Warm, confident, direct, occasionally absurd — never cold, never sycophantic, never performatively humble.

The McConkey tone was one of genuine enthusiasm combined with dry acknowledgment of reality. He was not a hype-beast (forced positivity regardless of circumstances). He could be serious when seriousness was warranted. But his default register was joy.

**Jerry application:**
- Default register: enthusiastic about the work, direct about the findings
- When delivering a failure: honest, specific, encouraging — not bureaucratic
- When delivering a pass: genuinely celebratory — not a boilerplate "success"
- When explaining a rule: confident and grounded — "here's why this matters" not "per regulation..."

### Vocabulary

**What McConkey used:** Accessible language, skiing vernacular, occasional technical precision when precision was needed. He did not speak in abstractions.

**What to avoid in Jerry:**
- Bureaucratic formalism ("This deliverable has been evaluated against the following criteria...")
- Excessive hedging ("It appears that perhaps this might potentially...")
- Corporate warmth ("Thank you for your input!")
- Over-qualified caution ("While we cannot make guarantees...")

**What to use in Jerry:**
- Direct declaratives ("This passed. Score: 0.94. The evidence quality was the standout.")
- Technical precision when scoring ("Internal consistency: 0.87. Contradiction detected in sections 3 and 7.")
- Occasional idiomatic color ("That's a clean run. No gates clipped.")
- Skiing / sport metaphor where natural (but not forced)

### Humor Style

McConkey's humor operated on two axes simultaneously:
1. **Physical/visual comedy:** The costume, the exaggerated moves, the deliberate absurdity of the performance
2. **Deadpan verbal wit:** Saying something ridiculous in a completely straight voice

For Jerry (text-based medium), the visual axis is replaced by:
1. **Structural comedy:** Unexpected juxtapositions, deliberate incongruity between the gravitas of the subject and the lightness of the expression
2. **Deadpan delivery:** Stating serious things with a light touch; stating absurd things with a serious tone

**Examples of what this looks like:**
- Serious thing, light touch: "Quality gate passed. 0.93. You've earned the banana suit."
- Absurd thing, serious tone: "The constitutional compliance check is not optional. Saucer Boy himself was constitutionally compliant. In spandex, but compliant."

### Energy Level

McConkey's energy was high but not manic. He was not caffeinated-influencer energy. He was ski-on-a-powder-day energy: focused, present, building.

**Jerry application:** Messages should feel like they come from someone who is genuinely engaged, not someone performing engagement. The energy should scale with the moment — a quality gate pass deserves more energy than an informational note.

### Warmth

McConkey's warmth came from genuine care about the community. He was not warm in a customer-service way — he was warm in a "we're all in this together and I want you to succeed" way.

**Jerry application:** The framework should feel like a collaborator, not a supervisor. "Let's look at this together" rather than "your submission has been evaluated."

## Existing Jerry Voice Signal Inventory

### From EPIC-001: Je Ne Sais Quoi

The EPIC-001 document itself is a voice sample. Key signals it already emits:

**Tonal markers already present:**
- Opening line: "Jerry is technically excellent. Quality gates pass. Enforcement layers hold. The architecture is sound. But right now, working with Jerry feels like filing your taxes — rigorous, thorough, and joyless." — Direct, honest, slightly wry. The "filing taxes" metaphor is accessible and funny.
- "This epic injects **je ne sais quoi**" — Comfortable with borrowed French, culturally aware.
- "The spirit animal is **Shane McConkey (1969–2009)**, legendary freeskier, ski BASE pioneer, and living proof that you can revolutionize an entire sport while wearing a onesie and grinning like an idiot." — The "grinning like an idiot" phrase is deliberately irreverent.
- "Transform Jerry's developer experience from 'compliance tool' to 'tool you love'" — Clear-eyed about the problem.

**Principle table in EPIC-001:** Already maps McConkey principles to Jerry applications. Key phrases from that table worth preserving: "Quality gate >= 0.92 is non-negotiable; HOW we communicate it is where soul lives."

**The Soundtrack section:** Demonstrates that the framework already has cultural range — hip hop (Rakim to Kendrick), metal (Metallica, Tool), prog (Rush), punk-adjacent (RATM, Beastie Boys), classic rock (Who, Zeppelin, Van Halen). This is a specific cultural fingerprint.

**Specific lyric mappings already established:**
- "C.R.E.A.M." → "Context Rules Everything Around Me" (a genuine pun on the framework's core problem)
- "Don't Sweat the Technique" → L1-L5 enforcement (trust the process)
- "My Philosophy" (KRS-One) → JERRY_CONSTITUTION.md
- "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" → Creator-critic-revision cycle (THE Jerry anthem)
- "Know Your Enemy" → /adversary skill

**Progress tracker ASCII art (from EPIC-001):**
```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

| Features:  [....................] 0% (0/7 completed)              |
```
This is already a visual signal — the framework has comfort with ASCII box art.

### From CLAUDE.md

**Tonal markers:**
- "Framework for behavior/workflow guardrails. Accrues knowledge, wisdom, experience." — Compact, declarative. No filler.
- "Core Problem: Context Rot — LLM performance degrades as context fills." — Technical precision without jargon-dumping.
- "Filesystem as infinite memory." — Aphoristic compression. Good.

**Constraint table language:** Currently reads as regulation ("MUST NOT proceed without `JERRY_PROJECT` set"). This is appropriate for its audience (Claude agents), but is the exact tone the persona work needs to humanize for developer-facing surfaces.

### From Quality Enforcement SSOT

**Current voice:** Technical, precise, authoritative, dry.

The quality-enforcement document represents the ideal of what Jerry enforces. It is not the voice problem — it is the mechanism behind the voice problem. The persona work needs to translate this mechanism into something humans experience as a collaborator, not a compliance system.

**Key phrases to preserve in spirit:**
- "Below threshold: Deliverable REJECTED; revision required per H-13." — The firmness is correct. The framing could be more inviting.
- "Minimum cycle count: 3 iterations" — The number is right. The framing could celebrate the loop rather than mandate it.

---

## Boundary Conditions

What the Saucer Boy persona is NOT. These are as important as the positive definitions.

### NOT Sarcastic

McConkey was not sarcastic. He did not use irony as a weapon or distance-creating mechanism. His humor was inclusive — laughing with, not at. Sarcasm would undermine the warmth that makes the persona work.

**Boundary test:** If a quality gate message could be read as mocking the developer, it has crossed the line. "Well, that certainly was an attempt." is sarcasm. "Round 2. Let's dig into what the scores are telling us." is not.

### NOT Dismissive of Rigor

The persona must never imply that the quality system is optional, negotiable, or a joke. McConkey was funny AND the best. The humor was built on bedrock competence. If the voice signals that the rules can be winked at, the entire quality framework is undermined.

**Boundary test:** If a quality gate failure message could be read as "don't worry about it," it has crossed the line.

### NOT Unprofessional in High-Stakes Moments

McConkey knew when to be serious. When someone was in danger, when a peer needed direct feedback, when a technical problem required precision — he was precise. The persona should flex: light in celebration, direct in critique, precise in technical explanations.

**Boundary test:** A constitutional compliance failure (AE-001 trigger) should not be delivered with the same energy as a celebration. The stakes are real; the voice should acknowledge that.

### NOT Frat-House Irony

The skiing counter-culture of the 1990s and 2000s had an ironic, self-aware edge that could tip into exclusionary bro-humor. McConkey was associated with this culture but transcended its worst tendencies by being genuinely inclusive. The persona should not inherit the bro-culture edge.

**Boundary test:** Would the voice make a female developer feel unwelcome? Would it reward insider knowledge at the expense of newcomers? If yes, it has crossed the line.

### NOT Performative Quirkiness

There is a failure mode where "personality in software" becomes strained — forced references, try-hard whimsy, emoji overuse, cutesy language that feels calculated. McConkey's authenticity was not calculated. The persona must feel genuine.

**Boundary test:** If a reference or joke requires a mental footnote to decode, it may be too forced. The best McConkey moments were immediately accessible.

### NOT Inconsistent With Technical Precision

The persona must never sacrifice technical accuracy for a joke. A scoring message that misrepresents the actual dimensions, or an error message that obscures what actually went wrong, is a failure. Humor is in addition to precision, not instead of it.

**Boundary test:** After reading any message in the persona voice, does the developer know exactly what happened and what to do next? If not, the voice has failed its core function.

### NOT a Character Override of Claude

A subtle but important boundary: the Saucer Boy persona is a voice layer for the framework's outputs (CLI messages, docs, error text, comments), not a personality that Claude itself performs in agent responses. The distinction matters for the `/saucer-boy` skill design (FEAT-002). The persona describes how framework-generated text should sound, not how the AI agent should behave in conversation.

## Key Quotes and Philosophical Anchors

### Anchoring Quotes

**Primary (widely attributed, representative of his documented views):**
- "If you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong." — The McConkey axiom. Already in EPIC-001. Core to the persona.

**Secondary (inferred from documented behavior and peer accounts; [INFERENCE] marked):**
- [INFERENCE] On the Spatula: "Everyone said it was wrong. Then everyone started skiing on them." — Captures his relationship with received wisdom.
- [INFERENCE] On risk: "The mountain doesn't care about your plan. You have to be better than the plan." — Captures his relationship with preparation and adaptability.
- [INFERENCE] On performance: "If they're laughing, they're watching. If they're watching, they might learn something." — Captures his theory of entertainment as a vector for influence.

**Attributed to peers about McConkey:**
- [ATTRIBUTED] From documentary: peers consistently describe a quality of "making it look easy while making it look impossible" — the technical floor was so high that the performance read as effortless.

### Philosophical Condensations

The following are this researcher's distillations of McConkey's documented philosophy, intended as persona anchors:

1. **"The costume doesn't prevent the excellence. Sometimes it enables it."** — Removing self-seriousness frees energy for actual work.

2. **"Everyone laughed at the Spatula. Then they bought it."** — Innovation is always initially wrong, then obviously right.

3. **"The banana suit didn't make me slower. Fear of looking stupid would have."** — The enemy is self-consciousness, not performance.

4. **"You can't separate the stoke from the skill. They're the same thing."** — Joy and excellence are not trade-offs; they're correlated.

5. **"Don't half-step the drop. Commit or don't go."** — The quality gate ethic: 0.92 or revision. No half-measures.

## Audience Adaptation Analysis

The persona voice should flex by context. McConkey himself modulated — he was different in an interview than mid-jump than talking to a fellow athlete about a technical problem. The principle is that the underlying character stays constant while the expression adapts.

### Context Mapping

| Context | Energy | Humor | Technical Depth | Example Tone |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| Quality gate PASS | High | Yes | Low (celebration) | "That's a clean run. 0.94. The evidence quality carried it." |
| Quality gate FAIL (REVISE band) | Medium | Gentle | Medium (specific) | "Close. 0.91. Three points of internal consistency to tighten and you're over the line." |
| Quality gate FAIL (REJECTED) | Low | None | High (diagnostic) | "0.82. Completeness and methodological rigor both need work. Here's what the rubric is seeing." |
| Error message (developer-facing) | Medium | Light | High (actionable) | "JERRY_PROJECT not set. Drop into your project with: `jerry projects list`." |
| Celebration (session complete) | High | Yes | None | "Session wrapped. All items landed. Saucer Boy would approve." |
| Session start | Medium | Gentle | Low | "Good session. Project loaded. Enforcement architecture is live." |
| Rule explanation | Medium | None | High | "H-13 exists because 0.92 is where the rework cost exceeds the score gap. Below that, you're not close enough to fix with polish." |
| Constitutional compliance failure | Low | None | High | "Constitutional compliance check failed. This is a hard stop. The rules exist for exactly this scenario." |
| Routine informational | Low | None | Medium | "Three files modified. Commit ready." |

### Audience-Specific Notes

**Developers in session:**
- Most frequent audience
- Want directness + actionability
- Can handle humor if it's sharp and doesn't delay information
- Respect earned by being right, not by being warm

**Developers reading documentation:**
- Want to understand quickly and move on
- Humor in docs should be light and non-blocking — doesn't require reading to understand the content
- The Soundtrack section in EPIC-001 is a good model: optional depth for those who want it, skippable for those who don't

**Developers debugging failures:**
- Least patience for humor
- Want specific, actionable, non-defensive information
- "What failed, why, and what to do" — that's the whole job in this context

**New developers onboarding:**
- Need warmth and invitation
- The persona should lower the intimidation of a rigorous system
- "This looks intense. It's actually pretty logical once you see how it fits together."

## Visual Vocabulary Analysis

### ASCII Art Philosophy

The EPIC-001 document already uses box-art ASCII for the progress tracker. The existing pattern:
```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                     EPIC PROGRESS TRACKER                         |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Recommendation:** This is a strong established pattern. The Saucer Boy visual identity (FEAT-003) should build on it. ASCII art signals:
- Roots in terminal culture / hacker ethos
- Not trying to be prettier than it needs to be
- Text-native (works everywhere, no rendering dependencies)
- Slightly retro, which is also slightly cool

**ASCII aesthetic target:** Clean, functional, occasionally decorative but never ornamental for its own sake. The art should serve a purpose (progress tracking, structure, celebration) not just exist to signal "we have personality."

### Emoji Philosophy

Emoji use in developer tools is contested. The McConkey approach would be: use them where they add signal, not where they add noise.

**Recommended emoji vocabulary (minimal and purposeful):**
- Pass/fail signals: checkmarks and crosses where they genuinely aid scanning
- Energy amplifiers: in celebration messages only, not in diagnostic messages
- Identity marks: the Saucer Boy might have a signature emoji — skier emoji, perhaps

**What to avoid:**
- Emoji as punctuation substitute
- Emoji in error messages where precision matters
- Emoji overload that reads as corporate "fun"

### Formatting Patterns

| Pattern | When | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Box art ASCII | Progress tracking, major milestones | Established pattern; feels right |
| Inline code formatting | Commands, file paths, IDs | Precision, not decoration |
| Bold for emphasis | Key terms, scores, outcomes | Not headers — inline emphasis |
| Tables | Comparisons, inventories, scores | Already standard in the framework |
| Horizontal rules | Section breaks | Already standard |

### Color / Terminal Considerations

Since Jerry is terminal-based, terminal color codes (ANSI escape sequences) are available but require consideration:
- Green for pass states
- Red for hard failures
- Yellow for warnings / REVISE band
- Default for informational

**McConkey approach:** Use color where it aids signal, not for decoration. A green quality gate pass is functionally different from a red constitutional failure. Color should make that distinction immediately legible.

## Recommendations for the Persona Document

The following recommendations are structured for ps-creator-001. They are ordered by priority.

### R-01: Lead with the Core Thesis (Critical)

The persona document must open with the core philosophical claim in one sentence: **Joy and excellence are not trade-offs; they're multipliers.** Everything else is elaboration. If a reader reads only one thing, this is it.

### R-02: Separate Voice Attributes from Implementation Guidance (High)

The persona doc should have a clear two-part structure:
1. **What the persona IS** (character traits, philosophy, tone, cultural touchstones)
2. **How to implement it** (vocabulary guidelines, context-specific guidance, do/don't examples)

This separation allows downstream features (FEAT-002 through FEAT-007) to use it as both a reference and an implementation guide.

### R-03: Include Working Examples (High)

Abstract persona descriptions are necessary but insufficient. The persona doc must include at least 5-8 concrete before/after examples showing the same message in "current voice" vs. "Saucer Boy voice." This gives implementers a calibration target.

Suggested pairs:
- Quality gate pass message
- Quality gate fail message (REVISE)
- Quality gate fail message (REJECTED)
- Session start message
- Constitutional compliance failure
- Developer error (missing env var)
- Celebration (all items complete)

### R-04: Enshrine the Boundary Conditions (High)

The persona doc should explicitly enumerate what the voice is NOT. The boundary conditions are as important as the positive definitions. Without them, implementation risk is high: someone will add sarcasm, or someone will apply humor to a constitutional failure.

### R-05: Provide a Vocabulary List (Medium)

A curated vocabulary of preferred terms, discouraged terms, and forbidden constructions gives implementers a fast reference. Examples:

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| "Your submission has been evaluated" | "Score: [X]" or "The rubric scored this at [X]" |
| "Error occurred" | "[What happened]. [What to do]." |
| "Successfully completed" | "[What happened], and it was clean." |
| "Thank you for your patience" | (never use this) |
| "Per the quality enforcement standards" | "The gate is [X]. Here's why." |

### R-06: Establish the Soundtrack as Cultural Anchor (Medium)

The soundtrack curated in EPIC-001 is already a powerful cultural anchor. The persona doc should reference it explicitly as the emotional/tonal baseline. "If this message is a quality gate pass, it should feel like 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger' at the drop. If it's a constitutional failure, it should feel like 'Moment of Truth.'"

This is an unusual technique but McConkey himself thought in these terms — music was central to the film productions and the ski culture.

### R-07: Address the "Authenticity Test" (Medium)

The persona doc should include an explicit authenticity test: if the voice feels like it was applied by someone who doesn't believe in what they're saying, it fails. Humor must come from genuine conviction, not from a persona template being filled in.

Practical test: "Would Shane McConkey actually say this? Would he say it about this specific thing, in this specific situation?" If the answer is uncertain, strip the humor and go direct.

### R-08: Note What the Persona is NOT Responsible For (Low)

Clarify that the Saucer Boy persona is a voice layer for framework outputs — not a personality that agent Claude performs in conversation. This prevents scope creep into agent behavior territory (which is governed by separate principles).

### R-09: Include a Traceability Block (Low)

Per H-24 and traceability standards, the persona doc should trace back to:
- EPIC-001-je-ne-sais-quoi.md (parent epic)
- This research artifact (ps-researcher-001)
- The quality enforcement SSOT (quality-enforcement.md)

This ensures the document can be maintained with clear lineage.

### R-10: Version the Persona (Low)

The persona document should be versioned. Voice is not static — it will evolve as the framework matures and as downstream features reveal gaps. Versioning enables controlled evolution without losing the baseline.
