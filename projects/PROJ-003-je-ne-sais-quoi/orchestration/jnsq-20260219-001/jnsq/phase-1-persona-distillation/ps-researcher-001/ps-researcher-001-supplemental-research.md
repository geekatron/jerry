## Corrections to Initial Research

The initial research artifact (ps-researcher-001-research.md) contains one significant factual error and several items that need precision adjustment.

### CORRECTION 1: Birthplace — San Francisco vs. Vancouver

**Initial research stated:** "Born December 30, 1969, in San Francisco, California"

**Live sources state:** Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

**Evidence:** Multiple independent sources confirm Vancouver birth:
- Shane McConkey Foundation (S-02): Birthplace in Canada; relocated to Santa Cruz at age 3
- U.S. Ski & Snowboard Hall of Fame (S-03): "Hometown: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"
- TetonAT obituary (S-06): "born in Vancouver, British Columbia"

**Why the confusion may exist:** He moved to Santa Cruz, California at age 3 and grew up there. Some sources loosely associate him with California. The Foundation site confirms he "came into this world" in Canada and was relocated by his mother to Santa Cruz.

**Corrected fact:** Shane McConkey was born December 30, 1969, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

### CORRECTION 2: World Extreme Skiing Championship — "Multiple Wins" vs. the Record

**Initial research stated:** "World Extreme Skiing Championship winner (multiple times)"

**Live sources state:** More nuanced. The Hall of Fame (S-03) records that he was "2nd at the World Extreme Skiing Championships" in 1994 — not a win. His confirmed wins are the South American championships (1994, 1995), the U.S. National Freeskiing title (1995), and the IFSA World Tour championships (1996, 1998). He did not win the World Extreme Skiing Championship multiple times per available records.

**Note:** This may reflect different competitions sharing similar names, or sources may be collapsing competitive categories. The initial research should not assert "multiple World Extreme Skiing Championship wins" without specific sourcing.

### CORRECTION 3: Volant Spatula Year — 2001 vs. 2002

**Initial research stated:** "Volant Spatula ski is released [2001]"

**Live sources state (S-08):** The first prototype was taken by McConkey in August 2001 for a New Zealand film project. The first production batch of 300 skis was manufactured in October 2002 for the 2002–2003 ski season.

**Corrected precision:** The Spatula concept was sketched in 1996 (Argentina bar, beer napkin). First prototypes were hand-built in 2001. Commercial production began in 2002 for the 2002–2003 season. Initial research's "2001" is approximately correct for prototype phase, but commercially the ski was 2002–2003.

### CORRECTION 4: "McConkey" Documentary — Director Attribution

**Initial research stated:** "Directed by Steven Rosenbaum"

**Live sources state:** The documentary was directed by Rob Bruce, Scott Gaffney, Murray Wais, Steve Winter, and David Zieff. No source confirms a "Steven Rosenbaum" as director. This name does not appear in IMDB (S-11), Matchstick Productions (S-12), or Tribeca Festival (S-13) credits.

**Corrected fact:** Directors were Rob Bruce, Scott Gaffney, Murray Wais, Steve Winter, and David Zieff. Produced by Red Bull Media House in association with Matchstick Productions.

### CORRECTION 5: Saucer Boy — Spandex Onesie Description

**Initial research stated:** "Costume: Spandex onesie, typically form-fitting and visually absurd"

**Live sources state (S-25, S-26, S-27):** The Saucer Boy costume actually consisted of a snow disc (saucer), a climbing rope, snowblades (short skis), and a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey. He wore neon/colorful 1990s ski apparel — the "Bogner-clad" description appears in one source (S-25). The "spandex onesie" description is not confirmed by any source; it appears to conflate Saucer Boy with his general skiing style or other costume appearances.

**Note on initial research film titles:** The initial research listed "Focused" (2001), "Yearbook" (2002), "Claim" (2003), and "Superheroes of Stoke" (2006). The dates in the initial research do not match verified sources. Corrected years from IMDB/MSP records above. "Focused" and "Claim" exist but in different years than initially stated.

### Quotes From Initial Research — Classified

**"If you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong."**

STATUS: UNVERIFIED as a McConkey original. CANNOT be attributed to him as primary source.

Live search results found this exact phrase (with minor variation "something wrong" at end) attributed to **Groucho Marx** on Goodreads. No source found attributing this specifically to McConkey as originator. This does not mean McConkey never said it — it means no live source establishes McConkey as the origin. It is a widely circulating aphorism. The initial research correctly flagged it as [WIDELY ATTRIBUTED]. The supplemental research confirms: no primary McConkey source found. Do NOT present this as a McConkey original quote in the persona document.

**[INFERENCE] "Everyone said it was wrong. Then everyone started skiing on them."**

STATUS: INFERENCE — no source found. Not presented as a real quote anywhere in live sources. Consistent with his documented views but should not be presented as a quote.

**[INFERENCE] "The mountain doesn't care about your plan. You have to be better than the plan."**

STATUS: INFERENCE — no source found. Not attributed to McConkey in any live source checked. Do not use as a quote.

**[INFERENCE] "If they're laughing, they're watching. If they're watching, they might learn something."**

STATUS: INFERENCE — no source found. Philosophically consistent with documented behavior but has no citation basis.

## New Information Not in Initial Research

The following significant facts were found in live sources and were not included in the initial research artifact.

### 1. Birthplace Correction (Critical)
Shane McConkey was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, not San Francisco. He was moved to Santa Cruz, California at age 3. This is a factual error in the initial research that the persona document must not replicate.

### 2. Mother Glenn's Ski Credentials
Glenn McConkey was an 8-time National Masters Champion ski racer — not merely described as a "ski instructor" as in the initial research. This is relevant context: McConkey came from a serious ski family on both sides, which explains his technical foundation.

### 3. Father Jim McConkey — Whistler Connection
Jim McConkey founded the Whistler ski school and is in the Canadian Ski Hall of Fame. This is a notable credential not mentioned in the initial research. The McConkey skiing lineage runs deep.

### 4. Marriage Details
Sherry McConkey's full name is Shahrazade "Sherry" Smulders. They married on May 29, 2004, in Thailand. Not referenced in initial research.

### 5. Saucer Boy — Jack Daniels Secret Sponsorship
Jack Daniel's liked the Saucer Boy character enough to secretly sponsor segments in at least one film year, but declined on-screen credit for "liability reasons." [S-27] This is a delightful piece of lore that the initial research missed entirely — the character was so good that a major spirits brand secretly backed it.

### 6. Saucer Boy — The Actual Equipment
The Saucer Boy costume was not a "spandex onesie" as the initial research states. The definitive costume was: snowblades + snow disc (saucer) + climbing rope + bottle of Jack Daniels + neon 1990s ski apparel. Snowblades are short skis / ski blades, not inline skate frames. The character's name comes from the snow disc (saucer), not from a saucer shape in his skiing.

### 7. Saucer Boy — "Snowlerblading" Sport Promotion
The Moonshine Ink article (S-25) reveals that Saucer Boy was specifically promoting "snowlerblading" — a hybrid of snowblades and snow saucers — as a legitimate sport. The character had a self-contained origin story as a fictional proponent of a fictional sport, not merely a general satirical persona. This adds a layer of constructed absurdism that the initial research missed.

### 8. G.N.A.R. — Additional Context
G.N.A.R. (Gaffney's Numerical Assessment of Radness) was a real competitive game McConkey co-invented with Scott and Robb Gaffney at Squaw Valley. Points were awarded for performing challenges mixing ski skill with showmanship and outrageous acts. The 2010/2011 film documents an "official" game held after McConkey's death — the game was shut down by Squaw Valley Ski Corp after one day. [S-32] This fits the pattern of McConkey's provocations being simultaneously too radical for institutional acceptance and too popular to kill.

### 9. Competitive Record — Freeskiing World Champion Twice
The initial research described his competitive career broadly. Verified sources confirm he was the IFSA World Tour Champion in both 1996 and 1998 specifically — not just "multiple competition wins." He also won the South American Freeskiing Championship in 1994 and 1995, the U.S. National Freeskiing title in 1995, and the European Freeskiing Championship in 1996.

### 10. Wingsuit Ski-BASE Jump Date and Location Verified
February 25, 2007, at Gridsetskolten, Norway — the first-ever wingsuit ski-BASE jump. A specific date and named location were not in the initial research. This is now verified. [S-28]

### 11. McConkey's 8th Grade Essay
McConkey wrote in an 8th grade essay about his dreams of skydiving, helicopter skiing, cliff-jumping, and hang-gliding, concluding: "up to my death I would just keep doing fun things." [S-23] This is a remarkable piece of biographical detail — he articulated his life philosophy in writing before his teens, and he lived it exactly.

### 12. Lifetime Ban from Vail Resorts
McConkey received a lifetime ban from Vail Resorts after performing a nude backflip during a mogul competition. [S-29] This specific detail was absent from the initial research.

### 13. ESPN Skier of the Year 2001
Named ESPN Action Sport Awards Skier of the Year in 2001. [S-29] Not in initial research.

### 14. Laureus Nomination 2005
Nominated for Laureus World Action Sportsperson of the Year in 2005. [S-30] Not in initial research.

For INFERENCE quotes from initial research:
Do not use as quotes. Rephrase as paraphrase of documented philosophy:
```
McConkey's documented approach to ski innovation reflected his attitude toward received wisdom: when the Spatula was dismissed by the industry, he continued developing it [S-08].
```

### Epistemic Marking Convention

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|

- "If you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong." — No McConkey primary source found; traced to Groucho Marx by live sources
- Any quote marked [INFERENCE] in the initial research — none were confirmed by live sources
