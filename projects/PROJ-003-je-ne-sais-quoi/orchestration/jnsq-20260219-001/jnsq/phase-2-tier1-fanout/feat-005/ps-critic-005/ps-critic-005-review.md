## Summary

**Overall verdict: PASS**

Key findings:

- All 23 original EPIC-001 tracks are present and correctly accounted for. The expansion to 34 tracks adds 11 well-chosen tracks; none dilute the original selection.
- The BDP/KRS-One correction (DISC-002) is properly applied and noted in both the epistemic header and the document metadata. The corrected attribution is accurate.
- Framework mappings are consistently defensible. Every track earns its placement. The C.R.E.A.M. remix and the Madvillain/adversary-skill pairing are the two strongest mappings in the expanded set.
- Usage rules (where references can and cannot appear) are clear, actionable, and cover all the edge cases that matter for downstream implementation in FEAT-006 and FEAT-007.
- One minor metadata nuance on "Waiting Room" (Fugazi) and one wording inconsistency in "Alright" (Kendrick Lamar) — both are non-blocking at C1 criticality.

**Result: 23 of 23 original tracks present. Zero tracks missing. Zero tracks dropped.**

### New Tracks Added in Draft (11)

| Draft # | Title | Artist | Category |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|
| 2 | Teardrop | Massive Attack | Session Start |
| 3 | Building Steam with a Grain of Salt | DJ Shadow | Session Start |
| 6 | Electric Relaxation | A Tribe Called Quest | Flow State |
| 8 | Roygbiv | Boards of Canada | Flow State |
| 9 | Accordion | Madvillain | Flow State |
| 14 | Alright | Kendrick Lamar | Diagnostic |
| 18 | Waiting Room | Fugazi | Diagnostic |
| 21 | So What | Miles Davis | Hard Stop |
| 31 | Time: The Donut of the Heart | J Dilla | The Craft |
| 32 | DNA. | Kendrick Lamar | The Craft |
| 34 | Out of Step | Minor Threat | The Craft |

Wait — DNA. (Kendrick Lamar) appears at draft Track 32. Cross-checking against the original 23: DNA. is listed in the EPIC at position 7 (Hip Hop Modern). It is present in the draft as Track 32 (The Craft category). It is correctly counted once in both the coverage table and the Full Track List. No double-count issue; the track was re-categorized from the EPIC's implicit "Hip Hop Modern" grouping to "The Craft" — a valid editorial decision.

**Expansion rationale quality:** All 11 additions have defensible framework mappings and pass the genre guidelines criteria. The additions are cohesive, not filler.

## Detailed Review

### Soundtrack Philosophy

Well-constructed. Three subsections flow logically: why music matters, the McConkey eclecticism rationale, and how the soundtrack is used operationally. The distinction between "reference artifact" vs. "audio feature" is exactly the right framing — it pre-empts the question of whether Jerry will ever stream music.

The "depth without barriers" principle is stated clearly and is later operationalized in the "In-Joke Test." Consistent throughout.

No issues.

### The Curated Playlist (Categories)

Six named categories plus one bonus ("The Craft"). The category system maps well to the framework lifecycle:

- Session Start — correct energy (medium, focused)
- Flow State — correct energy (medium-high, locked in)
- Victory Lap — correct energy (high, celebratory)
- Diagnostic — correct energy (resilient, not defeated)
- Hard Stop — correct energy (low, serious)
- Powder Day — correct energy (maximum, euphoric)
- The Craft — correct framing (philosophical, not a lifecycle moment)

The category structure is internally coherent with the Audience Adaptation Matrix energy levels referenced in the persona doc (ps-creator-001-draft.md).

**One minor wording inconsistency (non-blocking):** Track 14 (Kendrick — "Alright") has "Gentle" as a qualifier in the body text ("Medium | Resilient | Gentle") but the Full Track List renders it as "Medium / Resilient" without "Gentle." The body and table are compatible descriptions, not contradictory — "Gentle" is a qualifier that was dropped in the abbreviated table format. This is acceptable at C1.

### Framework Mappings — Spot Check

Five mappings examined in depth:

**"Accordion" (Madvillain):** The DOOM-as-critic mapping is creative but not arbitrary — the masked persona, the relentless precision, the density. The lyric fragment ("Living off borrowed time") maps cleanly to context rot. Strong.

**"Waiting Room" (Fugazi):** "Patient boy / I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait" maps well to the revision cycle pause between passes. The "restless energy channeled into discipline" framing captures the Fugazi sound accurately and connects it to a real framework experience. Strong.

**"So What" (Miles Davis):** The modal jazz / constitutional constraints analogy (fixed modes, creativity inside them) is the intellectually richest mapping in the document. "So what" as the constitution's response to challenges is both accurate and memorable. Strong.

**"C.R.E.A.M." (Wu-Tang Clan):** The remix ("Context Rules Everything Around Me") writes itself. The piano loop as persistence metaphor is good. The lyric fragment rewrites the original cleanly. Strong. This will be quoted by developers who discover it.

**"The Memory Remains" (Metallica):** La-la-la refrain as context rot — "the melody persists even when the words are gone" — is the best line in the document. Accurate to how context rot actually works (structural patterns persist; specific content degrades). Strong.

All five spot-checked mappings are defensible and well-articulated.

### Genre Guidelines

Inclusion and exclusion criteria are specific enough to be actionable. The Jack Johnson vs. Beastie Boys distinction in the "Ski bro music" exclusion is exactly the right example — it names a hard case and resolves it with reasoning, not just assertion.

The "Ironic or novelty tracks" exclusion is important and correctly placed. The boundary condition ("NOT Sarcastic, NOT Performative Quirkiness") is consistent with the persona constraints.

One observation (not an issue): The genre distribution table at the end of the Full Track List counts "Metal (2)" but lists Metallica under Legacy and Tool under Flow State. Both are plausibly metal. The genre label is accurate.

### Usage Rules

Strong section. The two-table structure (CAN / MUST NOT) is clear and complete. The exclusions are correct: error messages, quality gate scoring output, constitutional text, governance escalation messages, security-relevant output, rule definition files. Each exclusion has a one-sentence rationale that is accurate.

The Attribution Requirements subsection with correct/incorrect code examples is implementation-ready. The "In-Joke Test" framing ("Would a developer who has never heard this song still understand the message completely?") is a sharp, memorable heuristic.

One observation: The MUST NOT list does not explicitly mention CLI system prompts or AI agent system prompts (e.g., rules injected via L2 re-injection). Given that the document correctly excludes `.context/rules/*.md` files, this may be implicitly covered. Not a blocking issue at C1 — FEAT-006 can address this edge case during implementation.

### FEAT-005 Implementation Notes

The repository path decision (docs/culture/SOUNDTRACK.md vs. root) is correctly classified as C1. The rationale for docs/culture/ is sound.

The downstream integration table (FEAT-006, FEAT-007, FEAT-002, FEAT-004) is the most useful part of this section. Each integration point is specific:

- FEAT-006: attribution format as implementation spec — actionable
- FEAT-007: Mood/Energy classifications as calibration input — actionable
- FEAT-002: validation against canonical track list — actionable
- FEAT-004: canonical emotional mappings (which song = which moment) — actionable

Maintenance procedures (adding/retiring tracks, 40-track cap) are practical and well-considered.

### The Full Track List

34 rows, all populated. No missing fields. Mood/Energy column is consistent with the body sections. The genre distribution and decade distribution summaries at the end are useful metadata.

**Metadata spot-checks (5 tracks):**

| Track | Artist | Album | Year | Verdict |
|-------|--------|-------|------|---------|
| Teardrop | Massive Attack | *Mezzanine* | 1998 | Correct |
| Accordion | Madvillain | *Madvillainy* | 2004 | Correct |
| Alright | Kendrick Lamar | *To Pimp a Butterfly* | 2015 | Correct |
| Time: The Donut of the Heart | J Dilla | *Donuts* | 2006 | Correct (released on his 32nd birthday, three days before his death — biographical note in the body is accurate) |
| The Memory Remains | Metallica | *Reload* | 1997 | Correct |

## Issues Found

| # | Severity | Section | Issue | Suggested Fix |
|---|----------|---------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Minor | Curated Playlist — Track 14 | Mood/Energy wording inconsistency: body text reads "Medium \| Resilient \| Gentle" but Full Track List reads "Medium / Resilient" (drops "Gentle"). Not contradictory, but inconsistent. | Decide on canonical format and apply uniformly. Either add "Gentle" qualifier to the table or drop it from the body. Suggested: drop "Gentle" from body to match table; it is adequately captured by "Resilient." |
| 2 | Minor | Full Track List — Track 18 | "Waiting Room" album citation: draft lists *13 Songs* (1989). The original recording appeared on the self-titled *Fugazi* EP (1988); *13 Songs* (1989) is a compilation of two EPs that includes this track. Most databases (Discogs, AllMusic) list *13 Songs* as the primary album for this track, so the citation is defensible and common practice. However, a strict primary-release interpretation would cite 1988. | Acceptable as-is for C1. If precision is desired for C3+: cite "*Fugazi* EP (1988), compiled on *13 Songs* (1989)." |
| 3 | Observation | Usage Rules — MUST NOT list | The exclusion list covers rule files and constitutional text but does not explicitly address AI agent system prompts / L2 re-injection content (`.claude/rules/` content injected at the prompt level). The intent is clear from context, but an explicit line would close the gap for FEAT-006 implementers. | Add one row: "\*\*L2 re-injection content\*\* — Agent constraint prompts are enforcement text, not voice layer content." Non-blocking at C1; recommend addressing in FEAT-006 implementation spec. |

**Blocking issues: 0**
**Non-blocking issues: 2 (minor) + 1 (observation)**

## Verdict

**PASS**

The draft is ready for synthesis. All 23 original EPIC-001 tracks are present and correctly attributed. The BDP/KRS-One correction is properly applied. The 11 new tracks add depth without diluting the original selection. Framework mappings are consistently defensible, usage rules are actionable, and the downstream integration spec is sufficiently concrete for FEAT-006 and FEAT-007 to build against.

The two minor issues (Mood/Energy wording inconsistency, Fugazi album citation nuance) are cosmetic and do not affect functional correctness. The observation about L2 re-injection content in the MUST NOT list is a gap to address at implementation time, not a reason to hold the document.

The document is ready for the adv-scorer-005 quality gate scoring pass.
