## Overview

Create a comprehensive operational playbook documenting how to detect, prevent, and mitigate plugin integration regressions. This playbook will serve as the go-to reference for future incidents.

### Problem Addressed

- **TD-003:** No documented regression prevention strategy
- **Origin:** BUG-007 - no documented process for handling similar issues

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Playbook documents detection strategies (how to find issues)
- [ ] Playbook documents prevention strategies (how to avoid issues)
- [ ] Playbook documents mitigation strategies (how to fix issues fast)
- [ ] Includes checklist for pre-release validation
- [ ] Includes troubleshooting flowchart
- [ ] Includes rollback procedures
- [ ] Reviewed and approved by team

## Playbook Outline

### 1. Detection Strategies

**Symptoms to Watch For:**
- SessionStart hook produces no output
- Jerry Framework startup message missing
- Import errors in hook scripts
- `pip` or `uv` dependency errors

**Detection Methods:**
1. Manual testing after plugin update
2. CI integration tests (EN-005)
3. Pre-commit validation (EN-005)
4. User reports

### 2. Prevention Strategies

**Before Merge:**
- [ ] Run pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Verify CI passes
- [ ] Test hook scripts standalone
- [ ] Check PEP 723 metadata present

**Code Review Checklist:**
- [ ] No new pip dependencies in hook scripts
- [ ] All imports are stdlib or PEP 723 declared
- [ ] Exit code is always 0 for hooks
- [ ] Output format matches documented tags

### 3. Mitigation Strategies

**Immediate Response:**
1. Identify failing component
2. Check recent commits for breaking changes
3. Rollback if necessary

**Fix Patterns:**
- Missing dependency → Add to PEP 723 inline metadata
- Import error → Check PYTHONPATH in hook command
- Silent failure → Add error handling with stderr output

### 4. Rollback Procedures

```bash
# Revert to last known good commit
git revert <breaking-commit>

# Or checkout previous version
git checkout <last-good-tag> -- .claude-plugin/
```
