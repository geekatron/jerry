## Research Questions

1. What work item types exist in ADO Scrum? (Epic, Feature, User Story, Task, Bug, etc.)
2. What properties does each work item type have?
3. What are the default states and transitions?
4. How are work items related (parent-child, links)?
5. What behaviors/operations are supported?
