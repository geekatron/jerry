## Overview

Research and analyze the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) to extract domain entities, properties, behaviors, relationships, and state transitions across portfolio, program, and team levels.

### Blocked By

None - can start immediately upon approval.

### Blocks

- [EN-004](./en-004.md) - Cross-Domain Synthesis

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Research (ps-researcher)

| # | Task | Status | Evidence |
|---|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Research SAFe hierarchy levels | COMPLETED | `research/SAFE-RAW.md` §1 |
| 2 | Research SAFe work item types | COMPLETED | `research/SAFE-RAW.md` §2 |
| 3 | Research SAFe PI concepts | COMPLETED | `research/SAFE-RAW.md` §6 |

### Phase 2: Analysis (ps-analyst)

| # | Task | Status | Evidence |
|---|------|--------|----------|
| 4 | Extract entity catalog | COMPLETED | `analysis/SAFE-MODEL.md` §2 |
| 5 | Extract relationships and behaviors | COMPLETED | `analysis/SAFE-MODEL.md` §3-4 |
| 6 | Document state machine | COMPLETED | `analysis/SAFE-MODEL.md` §5 |

---

## Research Questions

1. What are the SAFe hierarchy levels? (Portfolio, Program, Team)
2. What work item types exist at each level?
3. What properties are defined for each type?
4. How do items relate across levels?
5. What are the PI (Program Increment) concepts?
6. What is the Kanban system structure?

## Output Artifacts

| Artifact | Location | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Raw Research | `research/SAFE-RAW.md` | COMPLETED |
| Domain Model | `analysis/SAFE-MODEL.md` | COMPLETED |

## Domain Model Template

```markdown
## SAFe Domain Model

### 1. Entity Catalog

| Entity | Description | Level |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Epic | Strategic initiative | Portfolio |
| Capability | Solution capability | Large Solution |
| Feature | Program deliverable | Program |
| Story | Team deliverable | Team |
| Enabler | Technical foundation | All |
| Spike | Research/exploration | Team |

### 2. SAFe Hierarchy

```
Portfolio Level
├── Epic (Portfolio Backlog)
│   ├── Capability (Solution Backlog)
│   │   └── Feature (Program Backlog)
│   └── Feature (Program Backlog)
│       └── Story (Team Backlog)
│           └── Task
```

### 3. Entity Properties

#### Epic
| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| id | string | yes | Unique identifier |
| name | string | yes | Epic name |
| epic_hypothesis | text | yes | Business hypothesis |
| business_outcomes | text | yes | Expected outcomes |
| leading_indicators | text | no | Success metrics |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 4. Kanban States (Portfolio)

```
[Funnel] → [Analyzing] → [Portfolio Backlog] → [Implementing] → [Done]
```

### 5. Relationships

| From | Relationship | To | Cardinality |
|------|--------------|----|-----------:|
| Epic | realizes | Capability | 1:N |
| Epic | realizes | Feature | 1:N |
| Capability | contains | Feature | 1:N |
| Feature | contains | Story | 1:N |
| Story | contains | Task | 1:N |
```

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All 6 tasks completed with evidence
2. Research document captures all SAFe levels
3. Domain model covers Portfolio, Program, and Team artifacts
4. Kanban states documented for each level
