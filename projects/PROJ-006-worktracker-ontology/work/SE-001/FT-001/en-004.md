## Overview

Synthesize patterns across ADO Scrum, SAFe, and JIRA domain models to identify common entities, relationships, and state machines. This enabler produces the foundation for the parent ontology.

## Synthesis Approach

### 1. Entity Alignment

Map equivalent entities across all three systems:

```markdown
| Canonical | ADO Scrum | SAFe | JIRA | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|------|------|-------|
| Epic | Epic | Epic | Epic | Universal |
| Feature | Feature | Feature | - | Not in JIRA |
| Capability | - | Capability | - | SAFe only |
| Story | User Story | Story | Story | ADO uses "User Story" |
| Task | Task | Task | Task | Universal |
| Bug | Bug | Defect | Bug | SAFe uses "Defect" |
| Spike | - | Spike | - | SAFe only |
| Enabler | - | Enabler | - | SAFe only |
```

### 2. Property Alignment

Map equivalent properties:

```markdown
| Canonical | ADO | SAFe | JIRA | Type |
|-----------|-----|------|------|------|
| id | System.Id | id | key | identifier |
| title | System.Title | name | summary | string |
| description | System.Description | description | description | text |
| status | System.State | status | status | enum |
| priority | Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority | priority | priority | enum |
```

### 3. Relationship Pattern Analysis

Identify common relationship types:

| Pattern | ADO | SAFe | JIRA | Canonical |
|---------|-----|------|------|-----------|
| Hierarchy | Parent/Child | contains | Epic Link + Parent | parent_of |
| Blocking | Successor/Predecessor | blocks | Blocks | blocks |
| Related | Related | relates | Relates | relates_to |
| Duplicate | Duplicate | - | Duplicate | duplicates |

### 4. State Machine Comparison

Compare workflow states and propose canonical states:

| Canonical | ADO Scrum | SAFe Kanban | JIRA |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------|
| backlog | New | Funnel | To Do |
| ready | Approved | Analyzing | Ready |
| in_progress | Committed | Implementing | In Progress |
| blocked | - | Blocked | Blocked |
| review | - | Review | In Review |
| done | Done | Done | Done |
| cancelled | Removed | - | - |
