<!--
DESIGN RATIONALE:
This enabler ensures the PROJ-006 deliverables are properly integrated
into the main branch with full CI validation. The CI pipeline enforces:
- Code quality (lint, format, type-check)
- Security (dependency audit)
- Plugin compatibility (manifests, hooks, CLI)
- Test coverage (80% minimum across Python 3.11-3.14)

All bugs discovered during CI must be logged in work/SE-001/FT-001/
using the BUG.md template.
