## Objective

Develop comprehensive rules, patterns, and guides for building Claude Code agents within the Jerry framework. Research best practices for agent routing, trigger design, prompt architecture, and tool usage to codify reusable patterns.

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Claude Code agent architecture and capabilities research
- Agent routing and trigger best practices
- Prompt design patterns for agents
- Tool selection and usage patterns
- Jerry-specific agent development guides
- Rules and standards for agent quality

**Out of scope:**
- Multi-model agent orchestration (covered by PROJ-006)
- Agent SDK/API development
- Production deployment patterns

## Phases

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1. Research | Survey Claude Code agent capabilities, routing mechanisms, and community patterns | PENDING |
| 2. Analysis | Synthesize findings into pattern categories and best practices | PENDING |
| 3. Codification | Develop rules, templates, and guides for Jerry agent development | PENDING |

## Success Criteria

- Documented agent architecture patterns applicable to Jerry skills
- Routing/trigger decision framework with clear selection criteria
- Agent development guide with templates and examples
- Rules integrated into `.context/rules/` for enforcement
