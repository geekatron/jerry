## Summary

The PROJ-007 orchestration (agent-patterns-20260221-001) produced 7 primary deliverables through a C4-criticality, cross-pollinated dual-pipeline workflow. All deliverables passed quality gates (avg 0.957) and a C4 adversary tournament (0.952 CONDITIONAL PASS). However, **none of the deliverables have been installed into the framework**. They exist only as orchestration output artifacts.

This enabler tracks the work to install all PROJ-007 deliverables into their canonical framework locations, making them operational and enforceable.

## Scope

### Source → Target Mapping

| # | Deliverable | Source (orchestration output) | Target (framework) | Criticality |
|---|-------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Agent Development Standards | `ps-architect-003-agent-development-standards.md` | `.context/rules/agent-development-standards.md` | C3 (AE-002) |
| 2 | Agent Routing Standards | `ps-architect-003-agent-routing-standards.md` | `.context/rules/agent-routing-standards.md` | C3 (AE-002) |
| 3 | ADR-PROJ007-001: Agent Design | `ps-architect-001-adr-agent-design.md` | `docs/design/ADR-PROJ007-001-agent-design.md` | C3 (AE-003) |
| 4 | ADR-PROJ007-002: Routing Framework | `ps-architect-002-adr-routing-triggers.md` | `docs/design/ADR-PROJ007-002-routing-framework.md` | C3 (AE-003) |
| 5 | Pattern Taxonomy | `ps-synthesizer-001-synthesis.md` | `docs/knowledge/agent-pattern-taxonomy.md` | C2 |
| 6 | HARD Rule Index (H-32..H-35) | In rule file drafts | `quality-enforcement.md` HARD rule index | C3 (AE-002) |
| 7 | Agent Definition JSON Schema | Referenced in ADR-001 | `docs/schemas/agent-definition-v1.schema.json` | C2 |
| 8 | Auto-load symlinks | — | `.claude/rules/` symlinks for new rule files | C2 |
| 9 | CLAUDE.md navigation update | — | `CLAUDE.md` navigation table | C2 |
| 10 | Trigger map update | — | `mandatory-skill-usage.md` | C3 (AE-002) |

### Out of Scope

- Research artifacts (Phase 1-2) — remain in orchestration directory as evidence
- Cross-pollination handoffs — remain in orchestration directory as process artifacts
- Quality gate reports — remain in orchestration directory as audit trail
- Review/report artifacts (Phase 5) — remain in orchestration directory as reference

## Acceptance Criteria

### Installation Verification

- [ ] `agent-development-standards.md` exists in `.context/rules/` and is auto-loaded via `.claude/rules/` symlink
- [ ] `agent-routing-standards.md` exists in `.context/rules/` and is auto-loaded via `.claude/rules/` symlink
- [ ] ADR-PROJ007-001 exists in `docs/design/` with Status: Accepted
- [ ] ADR-PROJ007-002 exists in `docs/design/` with Status: Accepted
- [ ] `quality-enforcement.md` HARD rule index includes H-32, H-33, H-34, H-35
- [ ] Pattern taxonomy exists in `docs/knowledge/`
- [ ] JSON Schema exists in `docs/schemas/`
- [ ] CLAUDE.md navigation table references new rule files
- [ ] `mandatory-skill-usage.md` trigger map updated for agent-related keywords
- [ ] All pre-commit hooks pass
- [ ] All tests pass (pytest)
- [ ] PR created and ready for review

### Quality Gate

- [ ] Installed rule files match orchestration output (content integrity)
- [ ] No orphan references (every H-rule referenced in quality-enforcement.md exists in a rule file)
- [ ] Constitutional compliance verified (S-007)
- [ ] HARD rule budget validated (<=35)

## Criticality & Escalation

| Auto-Escalation Rule | Trigger | Minimum Criticality |
|---------------------|---------|---------------------|
| AE-002 | TASK-012, 013, 016, 020 touch `.context/rules/` | C3 |
| AE-003 | TASK-014, 015 are new ADRs | C3 |

Overall enabler criticality: **C3 (Significant)** — multiple files in `.context/rules/`, new ADRs, HARD rule budget impact.
