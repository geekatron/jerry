## Objective

Research the "Jerry of the Day" skiing/snowboarding culture phenomenon to understand its origins, humor, and community significance. Extract insights for creating Jerry Framework's personality and voice.

---

## Background

"Jerry" is affectionate slang in the skiing/snowboarding community for someone who:
- Makes clueless mistakes on the mountain
- Exhibits overconfidence without skill
- Creates unintentionally comedic situations
- Is often self-unaware of their "Jerry" status

**The Connection to Jerry Framework:**
Context rot and compaction lead to "Jerry of the Day" moments in AI coding - the framework helps prevent you from being a "Jerry" (making clueless mistakes due to lost context).
