## Objective

Research Shane McConkey - legendary big-mountain skier, BASE jumper, and creator of the "Saucer Boy" persona. Extract his philosophy, humor, and boundary-pushing spirit to infuse into Jerry Framework's personality.

---

## Background

**Shane McConkey (1969-2009):**
- Revolutionary big-mountain skier and ski-BASE pioneer
- Known for irreverent humor and not taking himself seriously
- Created "Saucer Boy" - a satirical alter ego mocking ski culture
- Famous for skiing in costumes, performing ski-ballet ironically
- Pushed boundaries while maintaining playful spirit
- Quote: "It's not about the skiing. It's about making people laugh."

**The Connection to Jerry Framework:**
- **Saucer Boy** is already our bot account name (`saucer-boy`)
- Shane embodied "wise fool" archetype - appearing foolish while being brilliant
- His philosophy: Push boundaries with humility and humor
- Perfect inspiration for a framework that helps prevent "Jerry moments"
