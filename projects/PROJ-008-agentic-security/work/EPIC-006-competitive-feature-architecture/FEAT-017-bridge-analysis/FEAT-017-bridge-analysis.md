## Summary

Systematically extract every dropped strategic item from ST-061 and map it against the completed security architecture. Identify what was addressed, partially addressed, or dropped for each competitive gap, leapfrog opportunity, feature priority, and architectural requirement.

## Children Stories/Enablers

| ID | Title | Status | Agent |
|----|-------|--------|-------|
| ST-062 | Bridge Gap Analysis | in-progress | ps-analyst-003 |
| ST-063 | Security-to-Feature Mapping | in-progress | ps-researcher-004 |
| ST-064 | Feature Requirements Derivation | in-progress | nse-requirements-003 |

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Every item from ST-061 sections 8-9 appears in bridge analysis with addressed/dropped/modified status
2. Security-to-feature mapping covers all 10 AD-SEC decisions
3. Feature requirements trace to both competitive gaps and security enablers
4. All artifacts pass S-014 scoring at >= 0.95
