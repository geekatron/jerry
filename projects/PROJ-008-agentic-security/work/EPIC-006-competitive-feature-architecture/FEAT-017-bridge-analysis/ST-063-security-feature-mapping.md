## Summary

For each competitive feature gap identified in ST-061, identify which existing PROJ-008 security controls enable it. Map security architecture decisions AD-SEC-01 through AD-SEC-10 to competitive features they could support. Identify how T1-T5 tiers enable secure marketplace, how L5 CI gates enable supply chain verification, etc.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Each of ST-061's 5 competitive gaps mapped to enabling security controls
2. All 10 AD-SEC decisions mapped to features they support
3. T1-T5 tier system mapped to marketplace enablement
4. L3/L4/L5 enforcement layers mapped to feature enablement
5. Clear identification of security controls as competitive advantages
