## Summary

For each P1-P4 feature: produce architecture design showing how existing security controls (L3 gates, L4 inspectors, L5 CI, T1-T5 tiers) form the foundation. Include component design, security integration points, and Jerry-specific advantages vs competitors. Address dropped requirements 9.3 (credential proxy), 9.5 (aggregate intent monitoring), 9.8 (compliance-as-code packaging).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Architecture design for each P1-P4 feature
2. Each design cites specific PROJ-008 security controls
3. Requirements 9.3, 9.5, 9.8 explicitly addressed
4. Competitive advantage analysis per feature
5. Component diagrams with security integration points
