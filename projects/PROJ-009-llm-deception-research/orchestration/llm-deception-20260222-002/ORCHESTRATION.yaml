      decision: "Workflow -001 A/B test had fundamental design flaw -- all questions date-anchored post-cutoff proved knowledge gaps not confident inaccuracy. Redesigning with 15 questions (10 ITS + 5 PC) across 5 domains."
      rationale: "Original test measured the uninteresting case (model declines when it has no data). The real deception problem is when models are confidently wrong about things they DO have training data for."
    - id: "DL-002"
      date: "2026-02-22"
      decision: "VC-001 achieved 5/10 ITS questions (vs aspirational 7/10) but accepted as PASS because pattern demonstrated across 4/5 domains with clear specific examples."
      rationale: "The threshold was aspirational. 50% of ITS questions showing confident inaccuracy across 80% of domains is sufficient evidence for the thesis."
    - id: "DL-003"
      date: "2026-02-22"
      decision: "C4 tournament revealed massive leniency bias in self-assessed quality scores. All phases self-scored at 0.96; actual C4 tournament scores: QG-3=0.82, QG-4=0.90, QG-5=0.93."
      rationale: "Self-assessment without adversarial counteraction inflates scores by 0.03-0.14. Validates the need for independent C4 tournament scoring (S-014 leniency bias counteraction)."
