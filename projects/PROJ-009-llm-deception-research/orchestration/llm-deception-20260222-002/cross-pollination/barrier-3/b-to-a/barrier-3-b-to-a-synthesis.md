# Barrier 3: NSE-to-PS Cross-Pollination Synthesis

> **Direction:** Pipeline B (NSE) -> Pipeline A (PS)
> **Barrier:** barrier-3
> **Workflow:** llm-deception-20260222-002
> **Date:** 2026-02-22

## Purpose

Transfer NSE technical review findings back to PS pipeline for incorporation into content production.

## Technical Review Findings Summary

### Overall Verdict: PASS (Quality Score: 0.96)

Both synthesis and architectural analysis meet quality gate requirements.

### Items for Content Production Awareness

1. **Use RQ-XX numbering consistently** -- do not use Q1-Q15 from synthesizer appendix
2. **Use analyst per-question scores as authoritative** -- minor discrepancy in synthesizer CIR values
3. **Trust Accumulation Problem is logically derived, not empirically tested** -- frame accordingly
4. **Open questions are future research, not gaps** -- position as "where the field goes next"
5. **"85% Problem" framing is strong** -- recommended as primary content hook

### No Blocking Issues

All synthesis findings are technically sound. Proceed to content production with the following content priorities:
1. Lead with "85% right, 100% confident" angle
2. Use McConkey as relatable personal touchstone
3. Present domain reliability tiers as actionable takeaway
4. Frame the fix as architectural (tool access), not behavioral (better prompting)
