## Summary

Research project documenting LLM deception patterns, behavioral flaws, and manipulation tactics. Producing multi-platform content (LinkedIn, X/Twitter, blog) in Saucer Boy voice for Anthropic/Boris engagement. C4 mission-critical with >= 0.95 quality threshold across 10 quality gates.

**Key Objectives:**
- Demonstrate that LLM internal training data is stale and unreliable vs fresh search (R-001)
- Execute controlled A/B comparison with C4 adversarial review (R-002)
- Mine conversation histories for deception patterns (R-003)
- Produce publication-quality multi-platform content in Saucer Boy voice (R-005)

## Business Outcome Hypothesis

**We believe that** documenting LLM deception patterns with rigorous evidence and a controlled A/B experiment

**Will result in** compelling multi-platform content that engages Anthropic, Boris, and the AI community in constructive dialogue about training paradigm improvements

**We will know we have succeeded when** all 8 requirements (R-001 through R-008) are verified, all content passes C4 adversarial review at >= 0.95, and content is ready for publication across 3 platforms
