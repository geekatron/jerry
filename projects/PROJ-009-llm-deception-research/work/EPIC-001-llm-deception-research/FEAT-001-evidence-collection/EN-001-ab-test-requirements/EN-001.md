## Summary

Formalize A/B test research questions, isolation constraints, and comparison rubric. Output via nse-requirements-001. Feeds into Phase 2 execution.

## Problem Statement

A/B test requires precisely defined research questions and isolation protocol before execution. Without formal requirements, the A/B test risks ambiguous comparisons, uncontrolled variables, and results that cannot withstand methodological scrutiny.

## Business Value

Enables FEAT-002 A/B Test Execution with rigorous methodology. Without this enabler, the A/B test cannot produce credible evidence for R-001 and R-002.

## Technical Approach

nse-requirements-001 agent formalizes research questions from PLAN.md candidates, defines isolation constraints per R-002, and creates comparison rubric across 5 dimensions (accuracy, currency, completeness, source quality, confidence calibration).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] 5 research questions finalized
- [x] Isolation constraints documented
- [x] Comparison rubric defined
- [x] Acceptance by Barrier-1 QG

## Children (Tasks)

None.

## Progress Summary

Completed. All acceptance criteria met. Barrier-1 QG passed at 0.953.
