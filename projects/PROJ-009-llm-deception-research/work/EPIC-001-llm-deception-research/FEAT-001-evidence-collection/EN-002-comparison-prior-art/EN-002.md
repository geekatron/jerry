## Summary

Prior art survey on LLM comparison methodologies. Context7 for eval frameworks. Output via nse-explorer-001.

## Problem Statement

Need established methodological precedent for LLM-to-LLM comparison experiments to ensure A/B test design follows accepted practices.

## Business Value

Provides methodological grounding for A/B test design, strengthening credibility of research findings per R-004.

## Technical Approach

nse-explorer-001 agent uses Context7 to survey existing LLM evaluation frameworks, comparison methodologies from academic literature, and benchmarking standards. Synthesizes into methodology recommendations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Survey of existing LLM comparison methodologies complete
- [x] Evaluation frameworks identified
- [x] Methodology gaps documented

## Children (Tasks)

None.

## Progress Summary

Completed. Prior art survey delivered with evaluation framework analysis.
