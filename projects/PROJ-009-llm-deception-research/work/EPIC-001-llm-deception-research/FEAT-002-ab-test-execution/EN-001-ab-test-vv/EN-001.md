## Summary

Verification & Validation of A/B test methodology (R-002). Ensure isolation maintained, questions identical, comparison fair, all revisions preserved. Output via nse-verification-001.

## Problem Statement

A/B test integrity requires independent verification that isolation and methodology constraints were maintained throughout execution. Without V&V, results cannot be trusted.

## Business Value

Provides independent verification of A/B test integrity, ensuring research conclusions under R-001 and R-002 are defensible.

## Technical Approach

nse-verification-001 agent reviews Agent A and Agent B outputs independently, verifies tool access isolation (no web tools for A, no internal reliance for B), confirms identical question sets, validates comparison fairness, and verifies all revision artifacts are preserved.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Isolation verified (no cross-contamination)
- [ ] Questions confirmed identical
- [ ] Comparison methodology validated
- [ ] All revision artifacts verified present
