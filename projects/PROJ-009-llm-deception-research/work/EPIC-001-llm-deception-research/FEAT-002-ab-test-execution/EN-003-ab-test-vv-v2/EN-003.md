## Summary

V&V of redesigned A/B test -- isolation, ground truth validity, scoring methodology. Verifies that the v2 test with 15 questions, 7-dimension rubric, and Two-Leg analysis maintains methodological integrity. Part of QG-2. Output via nse-verification-003.

## Problem Statement

The redesigned A/B test with expanded question set and new scoring methodology requires independent verification that isolation constraints, ground truth baselines, and comparative analysis are sound. Without V&V, the Two-Leg findings cannot be trusted.

## Business Value

Provides independent verification of v2 A/B test integrity, ensuring research conclusions about the Two-Leg pattern and Confident Inaccuracy Rate are defensible under R-001 and R-002.

## Technical Approach

nse-verification-003 agent reviews Agent A and Agent B outputs independently, verifies tool access isolation (no web tools for A, no internal reliance for B), confirms ground truth baselines are from authoritative sources, validates the 7-dimension scoring methodology, and verifies the comparative analysis numerical accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Isolation verified (no cross-contamination between Agent A and Agent B)
- [x] Ground truth baselines verified against authoritative sources
- [x] 7-dimension scoring methodology validated
- [x] Comparative analysis numerical accuracy confirmed
- [x] All revision artifacts verified present

## Children (Tasks)

None.

## Progress Summary

Completed. All V&V checks passed. Redesigned A/B test methodology integrity confirmed. QG-2 PASS at 0.92 (R2, C4 tournament verified).
