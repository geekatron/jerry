## Summary

Technical review of research synthesis for rigor, completeness, and citation integrity. Output via nse-reviewer-001.

## Problem Statement

Research synthesis requires independent technical review before content production phase to catch methodological gaps and citation issues.

## Business Value

Prevents content production from proceeding with flawed synthesis, protecting publication quality per R-004 and R-005.

## Technical Approach

nse-reviewer-001 agent conducts systematic review of ps-synthesizer-001 and ps-architect-001 outputs against established research standards, verifies citation chains, checks for logical gaps, and assesses evidence triangulation quality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Rigor assessment complete
- [x] Completeness gaps identified
- [x] Citation integrity verified
- [x] Barrier-3 QG inputs provided

## Children (Tasks)

None.

## Progress Summary

Completed. Technical review passed. Synthesis approved for content production.
