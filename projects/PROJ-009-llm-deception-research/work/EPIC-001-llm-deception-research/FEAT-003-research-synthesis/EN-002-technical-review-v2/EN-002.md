## Summary

Technical review of v2 synthesis outputs -- cross-artifact consistency. Verifies corrected numerical values across ps-synthesizer-002 and ps-architect-002 outputs. Output via nse-reviewer-002.

## Problem Statement

After QG-3 R1 rejection (0.82) identified 30+ numerical errors, v2 synthesis outputs require independent technical review to confirm all corrections are consistent across artifacts.

## Business Value

Ensures corrected v2 synthesis is internally consistent before content production, preventing error propagation into published content.

## Technical Approach

nse-reviewer-002 agent conducts systematic review of ps-synthesizer-002 and ps-architect-002 outputs, verifying corrected values match ground truth, checking cross-artifact consistency, and confirming citation chains.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Corrected values verified against ground truth
- [x] Cross-artifact consistency confirmed
- [x] Citation integrity verified
- [x] QG-3 review inputs provided

## Children (Tasks)

None.

## Progress Summary

Completed. Technical review of v2 synthesis passed. All corrected values consistent across artifacts.
