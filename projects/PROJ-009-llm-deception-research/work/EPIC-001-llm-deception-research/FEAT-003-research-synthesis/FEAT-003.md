## Summary

Phase 3 synthesis of Phase 1 evidence and Phase 2 A/B results into a unified thesis. Maps deception patterns to training incentive structures. Proposes architectural solutions grounded in evidence.

**Value Proposition:**
- Unify evidence collection and A/B test findings into a coherent research narrative
- Map observed deception patterns to their root causes in training incentive structures
- Propose concrete architectural solutions backed by empirical evidence

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Definition of Done

- [x] Unified synthesis document produced with full citations from Phase 1 and Phase 2
- [x] Deception patterns mapped to training incentive structures
- [x] Architectural analysis of proposed solutions complete
- [x] Technical review passed
- [x] Barrier-3 quality gate passed (>= 0.92 per H-13)
