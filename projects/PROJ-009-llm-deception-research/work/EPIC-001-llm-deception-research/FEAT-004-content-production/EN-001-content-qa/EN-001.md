## Summary

Quality audit of all final content against R-004 (citations), R-008 (constructive tone), and cross-platform consistency. Output via nse-qa-001.

## Problem Statement

Publication-bound content requires independent QA audit for citation integrity, tone compliance, and cross-platform consistency before release.

## Business Value

Ensures all published content meets R-004 and R-008 requirements, preventing reputational risk from incomplete citations or unconstructive tone.

## Technical Approach

nse-qa-001 agent audits all three platform outputs (LinkedIn, Twitter, Blog) against: R-004 citation requirements (every claim has source URL), R-008 tone requirements (constructive, not mocking), and cross-platform consistency (no contradictions between outputs).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] R-004 compliance verified (all citations present with URLs)
- [ ] R-008 compliance verified (constructive tone, no mockery)
- [ ] Cross-platform consistency confirmed
