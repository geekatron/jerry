## Summary

Content QA audit v2 -- VC-005 confirmed across all platforms. Quality threshold corrected from 0.95 to 0.92 per H-13. Verifies corrected values propagated consistently across all v2 content pieces. Output via nse-qa-002.

## Problem Statement

V2 content pieces require independent QA audit to confirm corrected numerical values are consistent across all three platforms and that the quality threshold aligns with H-13 (>= 0.92, not 0.95).

## Business Value

Ensures all v2 published content uses corrected values and meets the correct quality threshold per H-13, preventing publication of stale v1 errors.

## Technical Approach

nse-qa-002 agent audits all three v2 platform outputs (LinkedIn, Twitter, Blog) against: R-004 citation requirements, R-008 tone requirements, cross-platform consistency, corrected numerical values from v2 synthesis, and H-13 quality threshold (>= 0.92).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] R-004 compliance verified (all citations present with URLs)
- [x] R-008 compliance verified (constructive tone, no mockery)
- [x] Cross-platform consistency confirmed
- [x] Corrected numerical values verified across all platforms (VC-005)
- [x] Quality threshold confirmed as 0.92 per H-13

## Children (Tasks)

None.

## Progress Summary

Completed. All audit dimensions passed across all 3 v2 platforms. VC-005 confirmed. Quality threshold corrected to 0.92 per H-13.
