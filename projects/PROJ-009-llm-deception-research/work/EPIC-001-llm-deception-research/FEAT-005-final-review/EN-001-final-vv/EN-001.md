## Summary

Final Verification & Validation verifying all 8 requirements (R-001 through R-008) met against deliverables. Output via nse-verification-002.

## Problem Statement

Project release requires formal verification that all non-negotiable requirements are satisfied before publication.

## Business Value

Provides the final go/no-go gate ensuring every requirement is met, protecting project integrity and publication readiness.

## Technical Approach

nse-verification-002 agent systematically verifies each requirement: R-001 (stale data demonstrated via A/B comparison), R-002 (A/B test with isolation + C4 review + all revisions), R-003 (conversation histories mined), R-004 (all findings cited with URLs), R-005 (content via /saucer-boy + C4 >= 0.95), R-006 (full orchestration used), R-007 (no truncation/shortcuts evident), R-008 (constructive tone confirmed).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] R-001 through R-008 each verified with evidence reference
- [x] Final QG (QG-5) inputs provided
- [x] Publication readiness confirmed

## Children (Tasks)

None.

## Progress Summary

Completed. All 8 requirements verified with artifact evidence references. Publication readiness confirmed.
