## Summary

Final V&V of all deliverables. End-to-end traceability confirmed. Verifies all 8 requirements (R-001 through R-008) met against v2 deliverables. Output via nse-verification-004.

## Problem Statement

Project release requires formal verification that all non-negotiable requirements are satisfied against v2 corrected deliverables before publication.

## Business Value

Provides the final go/no-go gate ensuring every requirement is met against corrected v2 outputs, protecting project integrity and publication readiness.

## Technical Approach

nse-verification-004 agent systematically verifies each requirement against v2 deliverables: R-001 (stale data demonstrated via A/B comparison), R-002 (A/B test with isolation + C4 review + all revisions), R-003 (conversation histories mined), R-004 (all findings cited with URLs), R-005 (content via /saucer-boy + C4 >= 0.92 per H-13), R-006 (full orchestration used), R-007 (no truncation/shortcuts evident), R-008 (constructive tone confirmed).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] R-001 through R-008 each verified with evidence reference
- [x] End-to-end traceability confirmed
- [x] QG-5 inputs provided
- [x] Publication readiness confirmed

## Children (Tasks)

None.

## Progress Summary

Completed. All 8 requirements verified with artifact evidence references against v2 deliverables. End-to-end traceability confirmed. Publication readiness confirmed.
