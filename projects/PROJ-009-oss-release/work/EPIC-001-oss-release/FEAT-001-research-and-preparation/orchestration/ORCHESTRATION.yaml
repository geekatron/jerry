#
# CHANGE LOG v5.0.0:
# - MAJOR RESTRUCTURE: Phase 2 now uses 7 separate ps-architect agents (per DEC-003)
# - ADRs organized into 4 tiers based on dependency analysis
# - Tiered Hybrid PS/NSE coordination (D-003: Option C)
# - Per-tier quality gates: QG-2.1, QG-2.2, QG-2.3, QG-2.4 (D-004: Option B)
# - Explicit mandatory_reads with priority ordering for each agent (D-005)
# - Checkpoints at each tier boundary (D-001)
# - ADR-006 moved to Tier 2 after ADR-001 (D-002)
# - Added new agent registry entries for 7 ps-architect instances
# - Reference: FEAT-001:DEC-003 Phase 2 Execution Strategy
#
# CHANGE LOG v4.4.0:
# - Phase 1 COMPLETE (all 4 tiers executed)
# - QG-1 PASSED (0.942 average: ps-critic 0.938, nse-qa 0.946)
# - Barrier 2 COMPLETE with cross-pollination manifests
# - CP-002 checkpoint created for Phase 1 completion
# - Unblocked Phase 2 agents for execution
#
# CHANGE LOG v4.3.0:
# - Barrier 1 COMPLETE with manifest references (user decision Q1)
# - Phase 1 tiered execution structure added (user decision Q2: option B)
# - Checkpoint frequency changed to TIER (user decision Q3: option B)
# - Unblocked Phase 1 agents for execution
#
# CHANGE LOG v4.0.0:
# - Corrected base path to feature-level location
# - Added 5 new research agents for expanded scope (DISC-001 remediation)
# - Updated execution state (partial Phase 0 complete, QG-0 FAILED)
# - Added worktracker document references (DEC-001, DEC-002, DISC-001)

    decision: "Tiered execution within phases to respect data dependencies"
    rationale: "nse-risk cannot identify risks without seeing exploration/research outputs first"
    impact: "Slightly longer Phase 0 execution, but more accurate risk identification"

  - id: "DEC-OSS-003"
    date: "2026-01-31T19:00:00Z"
    decision: "Checkpoint after each quality gate"

    date: "2026-01-31T19:00:00Z"
    decision: "Auto-retry quality gates up to 2 times before user escalation"
    rationale: "Balance between automation and human oversight"

  - id: "DEC-OSS-005"
    date: "2026-01-31T21:45:00Z"
    decision: "Cross-pollination via manifest files referencing existing artifact paths"
    rationale: "User Q1: Manifests ensure downstream agents use correct files, maintain traceability"
    impact: "No file duplication, agents MUST read manifests before execution"
