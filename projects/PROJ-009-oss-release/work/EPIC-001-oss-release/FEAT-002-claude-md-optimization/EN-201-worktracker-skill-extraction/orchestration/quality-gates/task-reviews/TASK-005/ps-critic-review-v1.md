## Review Summary

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Completeness (C) | 0.95 | All source content extracted; minor typos preserved from source |
| Accuracy (A) | 1.00 | Exact match with source content verified line-by-line |
| Clarity (CL) | 0.85 | Structure is clear but could benefit from additional context |
| Actionability (AC) | 0.80 | Provides structure but lacks guidance on usage |
| Traceability (T) | 0.90 | Source reference included; line numbers not explicitly stated |

**Composite Score: 0.90**

## Adversarial Findings (MANDATORY minimum 3)

### Finding 1: Missing Line Number Reference (MODERATE)

**Issue:** The extraction metadata states "Source: CLAUDE.md (EN-201 extraction)" but does not specify the exact line range (360-399) which would aid future maintenance and verification.

**Impact:** Reduced traceability; future maintainers cannot quickly verify source alignment.

**Recommendation:** Add explicit line range to metadata: `> Source: CLAUDE.md lines 360-399 (EN-201 extraction)`

### Finding 2: Source Typos Preserved Without Annotation (MINOR)

**Issue:** The source content contains typos that were faithfully preserved:
- Line 24/372: "enouncter" should be "encounter"
- Lines 21/44 (372/395): Double period ".." at end of Discovery file comment

**Impact:** While preserving source fidelity is correct, readers may assume these are extraction errors.

**Recommendation:** Add a note: `> Note: Original source typos preserved for fidelity`

### Finding 3: No Usage Context or Cross-References (MODERATE)

**Issue:** The file contains only the raw directory structure without:
- When to use this vs. other worktracker rules
- Cross-reference to related rule files
- Practical examples of applying this structure

**Impact:** Reduced actionability for skill consumers who need guidance on how to apply the structure.

**Recommendation:** Add a "See Also" section referencing:
- `worktracker-folder-structure-and-hierarchy-rules.md`
- `worktracker-entity-rules.md`

### Finding 4: Potential Redundancy with Existing File (LOW)

**Issue:** `worktracker-folder-structure-and-hierarchy-rules.md` already exists in the same directory. The relationship between that file and this new extraction is unclear.

**Impact:** May cause confusion about authoritative source for directory structure information.

**Recommendation:** Document the relationship or consider consolidation.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Source content lines 360-399 extracted
- [x] Code block formatting preserved
- [x] All 36 tree structure lines present
- [x] Header format matches template specification
- [x] File placed in correct location: `skills/worktracker/rules/`
- [x] No content from Templates section (244-358) included
- [x] File name follows kebab-case convention

## Line-by-Line Accuracy Verification

| Source Line | Extracted Line | Match |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| 360 | 9 | YES - "## Work tracker..." |
| 361 | 10 | YES - "For worktracker" |
| 363-399 | 12-48 | YES - Full tree structure |

**Total lines in source block: 40**
**Total lines extracted: 40**
**Match rate: 100%**

## Decision

**PASS** with minor recommendations.

The extraction meets the 0.90 threshold. The identified issues are improvements rather than blockers:
- Accuracy is perfect (1.00)
- Completeness is near-complete (0.95)
- Minor improvements would enhance clarity and actionability

**Score Justification for 0.95+ scores:**
- Accuracy at 1.00: Verified line-by-line; exact character match including preserved typos
- No content drift, no additions, no omissions of meaningful content

---

## Iteration Status

**Iteration 1 of 3**
**Status: PASS**
**No revision required** (score >= 0.92)
