## Summary

Survey existing agentic security tools, academic research on LLM security capabilities, and industry perspectives. Map competitive landscape (PentestGPT, HackerGPT, XBOW, Microsoft Copilot for Security). Research documented LLM capability boundaries. Gather perspectives from industry experts (SANS, NIST), innovators (SpecterOps, Rapid7), leaders (Microsoft, Google, CrowdStrike), and community voices (OWASP, CISA, bug bounty researchers).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Competitive landscape mapping with capability comparison
- [ ] Academic research on LLM capability boundaries for security tasks
- [ ] Industry expert perspectives (all 6 source categories per R-006)
- [ ] Differentiation strategy documented
- [ ] Gap analysis: what prior art misses that PROJ-010 addresses
- [ ] Research artifact persisted to `work/research/stream-d-prior-art/`
- [ ] Passes C4 /adversary review >= 0.95
