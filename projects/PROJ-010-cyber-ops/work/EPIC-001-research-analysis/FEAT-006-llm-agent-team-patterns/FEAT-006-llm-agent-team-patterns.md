## Summary

Research multi-LLM agent frameworks, universal prompt engineering patterns, and portability architecture. Analyze LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, LiteLLM, Google ADK for multi-agent orchestration patterns. Study prompt engineering patterns that work across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and open-source models. Produce portability architecture recommendation.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Multi-agent framework analysis (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, LiteLLM, Google ADK)
- [ ] Universal prompt engineering patterns across providers
- [ ] Provider-specific feature analysis (what to avoid for portability)
- [ ] Portability architecture recommendation with evidence
- [ ] Research artifact persisted to `work/research/stream-e-llm-portability/`
- [ ] All sources dated and cited per R-006
- [ ] Passes C4 /adversary review >= 0.95
