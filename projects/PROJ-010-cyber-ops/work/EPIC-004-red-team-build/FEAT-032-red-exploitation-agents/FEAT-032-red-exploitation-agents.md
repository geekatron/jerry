## Summary

Build red-exploit and red-privesc agent definitions. red-exploit handles exploit development, payload crafting, vulnerability chaining, and PoC development across web, network, API, and binary attack surfaces. red-privesc covers local and domain privilege escalation, credential harvesting, token manipulation, and misconfiguration exploitation.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] red-exploit agent definition with real exploitation techniques (R-018)
- [ ] red-privesc agent definition with Linux and Windows escalation paths
- [ ] Both agents enforce scope verification before execution (R-020)
- [ ] Both agents mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics (Execution, Privilege Escalation)
- [ ] All findings include remediation guidance (R-021)
- [ ] All agents portable across LLMs (R-010)
- [ ] Passes C4 /adversary review >= 0.95
