## Summary

Build red-lateral, red-persist, and red-exfil agent definitions. red-lateral covers pivoting, tunneling, C2 communication, and living-off-the-land techniques. red-persist handles backdoor methodology, scheduled tasks, service manipulation, and detection evasion analysis. red-exfil addresses data identification, exfiltration channels, covert communication, and DLP bypass assessment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] red-lateral agent definition with pivoting and LotL techniques
- [ ] red-persist agent definition with persistence methodology
- [ ] red-exfil agent definition with exfiltration path analysis
- [ ] All agents enforce scope verification (R-020)
- [ ] All agents mapped to MITRE ATT&CK (Lateral Movement, Persistence, Exfiltration)
- [ ] All findings include remediation guidance (R-021)
- [ ] All agents portable across LLMs (R-010)
- [ ] Passes C4 /adversary review >= 0.95
