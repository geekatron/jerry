## Scoring Results

| Dimension | Weight | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Completeness | 0.20 | 0.97 | All 8 required sections present. 23/23 artifacts. 24/24 requirements mapped. 6/6 Phase 2 features assessed. |
| Internal Consistency | 0.20 | 0.96 | Decisions align across S-001, S-002, S-003. Roster, architecture, and readiness assessments are internally consistent. |
| Methodological Rigor | 0.20 | 0.95 | 6-stream parallel research with synthesis barriers. Cross-stream convergence strengthens findings. Conflicts resolved with rationale. |
| Evidence Quality | 0.15 | 0.96 | 130+ unique sources across all 6 R-006 categories. Sources dated 2024-2026. Major standards bodies and industry leaders represented. |
| Actionability | 0.15 | 0.95 | Per-feature Phase 2 input. 12 numbered ADRs with confidence. Risk register with mitigations. 7 specific open questions. |
| Traceability | 0.10 | 0.97 | Requirements matrix traces 24 requirements. Decisions trace to streams. Phase 2 features trace to evidence. |
