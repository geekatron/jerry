## L0: Executive Summary

Red team and penetration testing organizations -- both internal enterprise teams (Microsoft, Google, Netflix, GitLab) and consulting firms (SpecterOps, TrustedSec, Rapid7, CREST-certified firms) -- consistently staff roles beyond the "operator" archetype that the proposed /red-team roster emphasizes. Three critical roles appear across virtually all organizations studied: a dedicated tool developer/infrastructure engineer who builds and maintains C2 frameworks, custom tooling, and operational infrastructure; a social engineering specialist who handles the human attack vector independently from technical exploitation; and an OPSEC-focused role responsible for operational security, infrastructure resilience, and detection avoidance across the engagement. The proposed 9-agent /red-team roster covers the core kill chain well but has notable gaps in tooling/infrastructure, social engineering, cloud-specific operations, and the explicit OPSEC management function that separates elite teams from competent ones. Additionally, CREST certification structures reveal that management and quality assurance of offensive engagements is a distinct specialization (CCSAM certification) that extends beyond what red-lead currently covers.

---

## L1: Key Findings

### Finding 1: Tool Development and Infrastructure Engineering is a Dedicated Role

TrustedSec operates a Dedicated Research Unit (TRU) -- an in-house research team that continuously develops cutting-edge attack techniques and custom tooling. GitLab's handbook explicitly defines the "Red Team Developer" role as distinct from operators: "focused on building reliable, secure, and auditable tooling/infrastructure that enables operators to act." SpecterOps, creators of BloodHound, is an entire company built around offensive tool development. Rapid7 maintains the Metasploit framework, demonstrating that tooling is not a side activity but a core organizational function.

The tool developer role includes: C2 framework development and maintenance, custom implant/payload creation, infrastructure-as-code for engagement environments, OPSEC-hardened build systems, redirector configuration, and domain management. The proposed /red-team has no agent dedicated to this function. red-exploit touches on "payload crafting" but tool development and infrastructure engineering are distinct from single-engagement exploitation.

### Finding 2: Social Engineering is a Distinct Specialization

Every comprehensive red team structure studied includes social engineering as a distinct function. EC Council's red team composition explicitly lists "social engineer" as a named role alongside penetration tester and team leader. TrustedSec's red team includes social engineering as a core capability area. IBM's red team definition includes social engineering attacks alongside technical attacks and physical intrusion. CREST certifications include social engineering assessment capabilities.

Social engineering encompasses: phishing campaign design and execution, pretexting and vishing, baiting and tailgating, credential harvesting via social channels, and open-source intelligence (OSINT) for social targeting. The proposed /red-team's red-recon handles OSINT and red-exploit handles "web app, network, API, binary exploitation" -- but the human attack vector (phishing, vishing, pretexting) has no dedicated coverage. Social engineering requires different skills (psychology, communications, scenario design) than technical exploitation.

### Finding 3: Operational Security (OPSEC) is a Cross-Cutting Concern with Dedicated Ownership

SANS SEC565 (Red Team Operations and Adversary Emulation) emphasizes OPSEC as a first-class operational concern. Red team infrastructure guides consistently identify OPSEC as requiring dedicated attention: "Advanced command-and-control (C2) infrastructure involves a deep-dive focused on resilient attack frameworks, evasive redirector implementation, and OPSEC hardening." Key OPSEC principles include: segmenting by function, using redirectors to protect backend infrastructure, leveraging legitimate services for stealth, and maintaining strict OPSEC throughout operations.

The proposed /red-team distributes OPSEC across agents (red-persist mentions "detection evasion analysis," red-lateral mentions "C2 infrastructure") but no agent owns OPSEC as a primary responsibility. In elite teams, OPSEC failures compromise entire engagements -- it needs dedicated ownership rather than distributed hope.

### Finding 4: Cloud-Specific Offensive Operations are a Growing Specialization

GIAC offers a dedicated Cloud Penetration Tester (GCPN) certification. Cloud penetration testers "should possess a deep understanding of information security and cloud infrastructure, particularly with major cloud service providers including AWS, IBM, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud, and should understand cloud specific concepts such as networking, identity and access management, console applications, and functions." DataDog's open-source Stratus Red Team tool specifically targets cloud environments. CyCognito's 2026 red teaming guide identifies cloud security testing as a "bleeding edge" specialization.

The proposed /red-team's agents are largely infrastructure-agnostic, which provides flexibility but may lack the depth needed for cloud-native attack paths (IAM privilege escalation, serverless exploitation, container escape, cloud metadata abuse). This was explicitly listed as out of scope in PLAN.md ("Cloud-specific provider tooling -- future extension"), but the research indicates this is increasingly table-stakes for modern red teams.

### Finding 5: Engagement Quality Assurance Extends Beyond Reporting

CREST's certification hierarchy includes CCSAM (Certified Simulated Attack Manager) as a distinct certification from CCSAS (Certified Simulated Attack Specialist). The CCSAM role focuses on management of the entire engagement lifecycle: scoping, quality assurance of findings, methodology selection, team coordination, and client relationship management. CREST CCT-level professionals (10,000+ hours experience) are "responsible for running complete testing projects independently and directing and managing pen-testing teams."

The proposed red-lead covers scope definition, rules of engagement, and methodology selection. But quality assurance of findings (are the findings valid? reproducible? correctly risk-scored?), engagement deconfliction, and methodology adaptation during the engagement are distinct from initial scope definition. Netflix's Attack Emulation Team Engineering Manager role explicitly includes "drive remediation of findings and adoption of security controls" -- extending the lead role beyond the engagement itself into impact tracking.

### Finding 6: Physical Security Testing is a Named Specialization

IBM's red team definition includes physical security intrusion alongside technical attacks and social engineering. ASIS International's red team guide describes physical testing roles involving "lock-picking, badge reader manipulation and other control blind spots." EC Council lists "physical security" as a named specialization area for red team professionals. GIAC offers GAWN (Assessing and Auditing Wireless Networks) as a distinct certification.

The proposed /red-team has no physical security or wireless testing capability. While these may be considered out of scope for an LLM-based agent (LLMs cannot physically pick locks), the methodology guidance, attack planning, and finding documentation for physical and wireless assessments could be supported by an agent that specializes in these domains.

### Finding 7: Internal Enterprise Red Teams Emphasize Purple Team Integration

Netflix's Attack Emulation Team explicitly blends "offensive security, defensive security, and threat intelligence" and measures success through "increased control confidence, resilience, security awareness, and response readiness." Their team conducts "proactive and reactive attack simulations, supporting tabletops, control validation testing, attacker focused hackdays, purple teaming, workforce education programs." GitLab's red team mission is "to improve the security posture of the organisation by executing operations that mimic real-world adversaries" -- the emphasis is on improvement, not just finding vulnerabilities.

The proposed /red-team is structured primarily as an offensive engagement team. While purple team validation is planned as a separate phase (Phase 5, EPIC-005), the individual red team agents lack explicit integration hooks for purple team collaboration. Netflix's model suggests red team agents should natively support collaborative modes, not just adversarial modes.

## L2: Detailed Analysis

### Organization-by-Organization Breakdown

#### SpecterOps

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Focus | Red Team Operations, Adversary Simulation, Identity Attack Path Management |
| Key Product | BloodHound (Active Directory attack path analysis) |
| Training | Adversary Tactics: Red Team Operations (Black Hat, internal) |
| Services | Penetration Testing, Red Team, Purple Team, Threat Hunting, Detection programs |
| Model | Elite consulting with deep tooling development DNA |

**Relevance to /red-team**: SpecterOps demonstrates that tool development is not a supporting function but a core competitive advantage. BloodHound's existence shows that offensive tooling can be a product in itself. The /red-team needs an agent that can guide tool selection, custom tool development, and infrastructure configuration -- not just use existing tools.

#### TrustedSec

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Engagement Model | Single engagement lead per client (hands-on-keyboard + client interface) |
| Engagement Lead Role | Primary technical consultant AND client interface -- no separation between testing and communication |
| Research Unit | TRU (TrustedSec Research Unit) -- dedicated in-house research team for attack techniques and custom tooling |
| Staffing Philosophy | "No correct answer" on team size; most engagements are single-operator with lead overlay; large multi-month engagements may add resources for specific phases |
| Services | Red Teaming, Penetration Testing, Social Engineering, Physical Security |

**Relevance to /red-team**: TrustedSec's model shows that: (1) the engagement lead must be hands-on-keyboard, not just a manager; (2) dedicated research/tooling (TRU) is a distinct function; (3) most engagements are surprisingly lean (1-2 operators) but backed by deep research infrastructure.

#### Rapid7

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Key Products | Metasploit (exploitation framework), Nexpose/InsightVM (vulnerability scanning) |
| Team Backgrounds | Security, IT, software development, Red Team operations, IoT pentesting, exploitation development |
| Methodology | PTES, OWASP-based |
| Service Areas | External network testing, web application testing, mobile testing, continuous red teaming |
| Approach | Expert-led with combination of manual expertise and automated technology |

**Relevance to /red-team**: Rapid7's team composition (expertise "ranging across security, IT, and software development") confirms that red team capability requires software engineering skill alongside security expertise. The /red-team's proposed agents are all security-focused; there is no "red team software engineer" equivalent despite Rapid7 and SpecterOps demonstrating this is essential.

#### CREST Certification Hierarchy

| Level | Certification | Experience | Role |
|-------|--------------|------------|------|
| Entry | CPSA (Practitioner Security Analyst) | 2,500 hours | Routine assignments under supervision |
| Mid | CRT (Registered Tester) | 6,000 hours (~3 years) | Independent security assessments |
| Advanced | CCT INF/APP (Certified Tester) | 10,000 hours (~5 years) | Run complete projects, direct teams |
| Specialist | CCSAS (Simulated Attack Specialist) | Advanced | Red team operative |
| Manager | CCSAM (Simulated Attack Manager) | Advanced | Red team engagement management |
| Wireless | CPSA/CRT Wireless | Varies | Wireless network security testing |

**Relevance to /red-team**: CREST's separation of CCSAS (specialist/operator) from CCSAM (manager) validates that engagement management and operational execution are distinct specializations. The /red-team's red-lead combines both, but CREST evidence suggests these benefit from separation. The wireless specialization certification confirms this is a recognized distinct domain.

#### Microsoft AI Red Team

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Focus | AI model security, adversarial ML, LLM safety |
| Scale | "Red teamed 100 generative AI products" (Jan 2025 report) |
| Approach | Simulate real-world cyberattacks on AI systems |
| Integration | Part of broader Microsoft security organization |
| Harvard Research | Harvard Berkman Klein Center published "Inside Look at Microsoft's AI Red Team" (April 2025) |

**Relevance to /red-team**: Microsoft's AI Red Team is a leading indicator that AI/ML security testing is becoming a distinct red team specialization. While not in the current /red-team scope, it is worth noting as a future extension point.

#### Netflix Attack Emulation Team

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Organizational Home | Part of Detection and Response |
| Mission | Blend offensive security, defensive security, and threat intelligence to improve security posture |
| Activities | Attack simulations, tabletops, control validation, purple teaming, hackdays, workforce education, threat intelligence |
| Success Metrics | Control confidence, resilience, security awareness, response readiness |
| Leadership | Engineering Manager leads diverse security engineers across many security domains |
| Key Mandate | "Lead and develop a diverse set of security engineers with broad backgrounds across many security domains" |

**Relevance to /red-team**: Netflix's model is the strongest evidence for purple team integration as a native capability of red team agents, not a separate phase. Their team measures success by defensive improvement, not just vulnerability discovery.

#### GitLab Red Team (Handbook)

| Role | Grade | Responsibilities |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Red Team Engineer | 6 | Execute adversary emulation operations |
| Senior Red Team Engineer | 7 | Lead operations, mentor juniors |
| Staff Red Team Engineer | 8 | Technical leadership, methodology development |
| Principal Red Team Engineer | (implied) | Strategic direction, cross-org influence |
| Red Team Manager | 8 | Team hiring, development, operational oversight |

**Relevance to /red-team**: GitLab's career ladder is the most transparent public documentation of red team role progression. It confirms that red team roles decompose by seniority/scope, not just by kill chain phase as the proposed /red-team does. This suggests the /red-team's phase-based decomposition (recon, vuln, exploit, etc.) is one valid model but not the only one.

### Composite Role Matrix: Industry vs. Proposed /red-team

| Role/Function | SpecterOps | TrustedSec | Rapid7 | CREST | Microsoft RT | Netflix RT | GitLab RT | Proposed /red-team | Coverage |

### Engagement Staffing Patterns

| Engagement Type | Typical Team Size | Roles Typically Staffed | Duration |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------|----------|
| Standard Pentest | 1-2 operators | Lead + Tester | 1-2 weeks |
| Red Team Engagement | 2-4 operators + support | Lead, Operators, Social Engineer, Infrastructure | 2-4 weeks |
| Large Enterprise Red Team | 4-8 operators + support | Lead, Multiple Operators (by specialty), Social Engineer, Tool Dev, Infrastructure, Report Writer | 1-3 months |
| Continuous Red Team | 3-6 full-time | All roles, rotating focus areas | Ongoing |
| Adversary Emulation (APT sim) | 3-5 operators + intel | Lead, TI Analyst, Operators (by kill chain), Infrastructure | 2-6 weeks |

**Key Insight**: Even in lean engagements (1-2 people), the individuals perform multiple roles. The /red-team's 9-agent model maps better to the "large enterprise" or "continuous" engagement patterns where specialization is viable. This is appropriate for the skill's scope, but the missing roles (tool development, social engineering, infrastructure) become critical at this specialization level.

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (Present in 3+ organizations, absent from /red-team)

| Gap | Severity | Evidence | Impact |
|-----|----------|----------|--------|
| **No Tool Developer / Infrastructure Agent** | HIGH | TrustedSec TRU (dedicated), SpecterOps (BloodHound team), Rapid7 (Metasploit team), GitLab RT (developer role), all enterprise RTs maintain custom tooling | The /red-team cannot guide C2 infrastructure setup, custom payload development, redirector configuration, domain management, or infrastructure-as-code for engagement environments. Operators (red-exploit, red-lateral, etc.) need tooling/infrastructure support that no agent provides. |
| **No Social Engineering Agent** | HIGH | EC Council (named role), TrustedSec (dedicated service), IBM (core red team function), Netflix (workforce education), ASIS (physical + social) | The human attack vector -- phishing, vishing, pretexting, credential harvesting via social channels -- has zero coverage. This is consistently identified as one of the three pillars of red teaming (technical, social, physical). |
| **No Dedicated OPSEC / Infrastructure Management** | MEDIUM-HIGH | SANS SEC565 (OPSEC as first-class concern), Outflank (OPSEC-focused C2), all infrastructure guides emphasize OPSEC hardening, red team infrastructure = segmentation + redirectors + stealth | OPSEC is distributed across agents but no agent owns it. red-persist touches "detection evasion analysis" and red-lateral touches "C2 infrastructure," but operational security of the engagement itself (avoiding blue team detection, infrastructure resilience, artifact cleanup) has no primary owner. |

### Moderate Gaps (Present in 1-2 organizations or emerging trend)

| Gap | Severity | Evidence | Impact |
|-----|----------|----------|--------|
| **No Cloud-Specific Offensive Agent** | MEDIUM | GIAC GCPN certification, DataDog Stratus Red Team, CyCognito 2026 trends, cloud-native attack paths are distinct | Cloud IAM exploitation, serverless attacks, container escapes, metadata abuse, and cloud-specific lateral movement require specialized knowledge. Listed as out of scope in PLAN.md but represents growing industry need. |
| **No Physical/Wireless Testing Agent** | MEDIUM | ASIS (physical security), GIAC GAWN (wireless), TrustedSec (physical service), CREST (wireless cert) | Physical security testing (lock picking, badge cloning, tailgating methodology) and wireless testing (WiFi, Bluetooth, RF) have no coverage. LLM limitations apply to execution but methodology guidance, planning, and reporting could be supported. |
| **No QA/Validation of Findings Agent** | LOW-MEDIUM | CREST CCSAM (engagement management includes QA), implicit in all firms | Findings quality assurance -- verifying reproducibility, accurate risk scoring, correct remediation guidance, deconfliction -- is distinct from finding vulnerabilities and from reporting them. red-reporter documents but does not validate. |
| **No Threat Intelligence Agent** | LOW-MEDIUM | Netflix RT integrates TI natively, Mandiant TI informs red ops, APT emulation requires TI | Adversary emulation engagements require threat intelligence to select TTPs. Without a TI function, the /red-team simulates generic attackers rather than specific threat actors. May be handled by cross-skill integration with /eng-team's proposed eng-threatintel or through /problem-solving research. |

### Structural Gaps

| Gap | Nature | Evidence |
|-----|--------|----------|
| **Kill-chain-based decomposition may be too rigid** | The proposed agents map to kill chain phases (recon -> vuln -> exploit -> privesc -> lateral -> persist -> exfil). Real engagements are iterative and non-linear. An operator may cycle between exploitation and recon multiple times. | GitLab decomposes by seniority, not kill chain. TrustedSec uses single operators who span the full chain. Kill chain decomposition is valid for methodology guidance but may create artificial handoff points. |
| **No explicit purple team collaboration mode** | The /red-team agents are designed for adversarial operation. Purple team validation is Phase 5 (separate). Netflix's model shows red teams should natively support collaborative modes. | Netflix Attack Emulation Team: "blends offensive security, defensive security, and threat intelligence." Purple teaming is a mode, not a phase. |
| **Engagement lead scope may be too narrow** | red-lead covers scope, RoE, methodology, authorization. Missing: mid-engagement methodology adaptation, findings validation, deconfliction, client communication during engagement, impact tracking post-engagement. | TrustedSec: engagement lead is hands-on-keyboard AND client interface. CREST CCSAM: management includes QA and lifecycle. Netflix EM: includes remediation tracking and control adoption. |

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Add Missing Agents (HIGH confidence)

| Proposed Agent | Role | Rationale |
|----------------|------|-----------|
| **red-infra** | Infrastructure and Tool Engineer | Owns C2 infrastructure design, redirector configuration, domain management, custom payload development, implant creation, infrastructure-as-code for engagement environments, OPSEC hardening of all operational infrastructure. Based on TrustedSec TRU, SpecterOps tooling DNA, Rapid7 Metasploit team, GitLab Red Team Developer role. |
| **red-social** | Social Engineering Specialist | Owns phishing campaign design, pretexting scenario development, vishing methodology, credential harvesting via social channels, physical pretexting planning, and social attack vector integration with technical exploitation. Based on EC Council role taxonomy, TrustedSec service offering, IBM/ASIS red team definitions. |

### Priority 2: Add Conditional Agents (MEDIUM confidence)

| Proposed Agent | Role | Rationale |
|----------------|------|-----------|
| **red-opsec** | OPSEC Manager | Owns operational security across the entire engagement: communication security, infrastructure resilience, artifact cleanup, detection avoidance strategy, blue team deconfliction, and operational discipline enforcement. Based on SANS SEC565, Outflank OPSEC-focused C2, all infrastructure guides. Alternative: make OPSEC an explicit responsibility of red-lead or red-infra rather than a standalone agent. |
| **red-cloud** | Cloud Offensive Specialist | Owns cloud-native attack paths: IAM privilege escalation, serverless exploitation, container escape, cloud metadata abuse, cross-account lateral movement, cloud-specific persistence. Based on GIAC GCPN, DataDog Stratus, CyCognito 2026 trends. Currently out of scope per PLAN.md but strongly indicated by research. |

### Priority 3: Structural Adjustments (HIGH confidence)

| Adjustment | Description | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Expand red-lead scope** | Add mid-engagement methodology adaptation, findings validation/QA, deconfliction management, and post-engagement impact tracking to red-lead's responsibilities. | CREST CCSAM covers full lifecycle. TrustedSec lead is hands-on + client-facing. Netflix EM tracks remediation and control adoption. Current scope is too narrow for engagement management. |
| **Add purple team collaboration mode** | Design all red team agents to support both adversarial mode (attack) and collaborative mode (purple team). Add explicit integration hooks for defensive team collaboration. | Netflix measures success by defensive improvement. Purple teaming is a mode of operation, not a separate phase. |
| **Make kill chain phases non-linear** | Ensure the routing and workflow support iterative cycling (e.g., exploitation discovers new recon targets, requiring return to red-recon). The methodology should be a framework, not a rigid sequence. | Real engagements are non-linear. TrustedSec operators span the full chain. Kill chain is a framework for organizing capability, not a workflow sequence. |

### Summary: Proposed /red-team Roster Change

| Current (9 agents) | Proposed (11-13 agents) | Change |
|--------------------|------------------------|--------|
| red-lead | red-lead | Expanded scope: add QA, lifecycle management, adaptation |
| red-recon | red-recon | No change |
| red-vuln | red-vuln | No change |
| red-exploit | red-exploit | No change |
| red-privesc | red-privesc | No change |
| red-lateral | red-lateral | No change |
| red-persist | red-persist | No change |
| red-exfil | red-exfil | No change |
| red-reporter | red-reporter | No change |
| -- | **red-infra** (NEW) | Tool development, C2 infrastructure, OPSEC hardening |
| -- | **red-social** (NEW) | Social engineering specialist |
| -- | red-opsec (conditional NEW) | Dedicated OPSEC management (or merge into red-infra/red-lead) |
| -- | red-cloud (conditional NEW) | Cloud-specific offensive operations (currently out of scope) |

**Net assessment**: The proposed 9-agent roster covers the core technical kill chain comprehensively but misses three capabilities that appear in virtually every elite red team: tool development/infrastructure engineering, social engineering, and dedicated OPSEC management. Adding red-infra and red-social is strongly supported by evidence across all organization types studied. Whether OPSEC warrants a standalone agent or should be distributed between red-infra (infrastructure OPSEC) and red-lead (operational OPSEC) is a design decision for Phase 2 architecture. Cloud-specific offensive operations are the most significant deferred capability.
