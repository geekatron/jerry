## Summary

Create Slack promotion messages (short version + longer version) to drive traffic to the blog post. Format for Slack's Markdown subset. Include key hooks from the article without over-claiming.

**Note:** Slack message format has a structural quality ceiling (~0.68-0.72) due to character constraints and format limitations. Retired from S-014 scoring at iteration 4. Accepted as promotional artifact with P6 caveats applied for cross-channel consistency.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC-1: Short version (< 200 words) with key hook and blog URL placeholder
- [x] AC-2: Longer version with three-level framework summary and blog URL placeholder
- [x] AC-3: P6 caveats applied (qualifiers matching Medium article hedging)
- [x] AC-4: Formatted for Slack Markdown subset
