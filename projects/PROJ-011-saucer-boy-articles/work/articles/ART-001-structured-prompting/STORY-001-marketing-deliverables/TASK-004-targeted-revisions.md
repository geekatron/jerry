## Summary

Apply prioritized revisions from the cross-strategy convergence analysis to the Medium article and Slack message. P1-P5 target the Medium article (must-fix and should-fix). P6 targets the Slack message (cross-channel consistency caveats).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC-1: P1 (C-01 universal claim) -- model names and session count added
- [x] AC-2: P2 (C-02 B&K over-extension) -- inferential bridge explicitly marked
- [x] AC-3: P3 (C-05 tool-access caveat) -- parenthetical added after Level 3 prompt
- [x] AC-4: P4 (C-04 Liu et al. scope) -- study-type distinction strengthened
- [x] AC-5: P5 (C-07 RLHF overbroad) -- "amplifies" changed to "can amplify"
- [x] AC-6: P6 (C-06 Slack caveats) -- qualifiers added to Slack message

## Revisions Applied

| P2 | C-02: B&K over-extension | Medium | Reframed to explicitly mark theory-to-practice inferential bridge |
| P3 | C-05: Tool-access caveat | Medium | Added parenthetical after Level 3 prompt block |
| P4 | C-04: Liu et al. scope | Medium | Strengthened hedge with specific study-type distinction |
| P5 | C-07: RLHF overbroad | Medium | Changed "amplifies" to "can amplify" |
| P6 | C-06: Slack caveats | Slack | Added "at least without structure" and "in my testing across ~200 sessions" |
