# PROJ-012: Agent Definition Optimization

## Objective

Optimize agent definitions across the Jerry Framework for improved performance, reduced token consumption, and better routing accuracy.

## Scope

- Audit existing agent definitions for bloat, redundancy, and inefficiency
- Optimize YAML frontmatter and markdown body sections
- Reduce token footprint while maintaining behavioral fidelity
- Improve progressive disclosure (Tier 1/2/3 loading efficiency)
- Validate optimizations against quality gate (H-13, >= 0.92)

## Status

**Phase:** Planning

## Phases

1. **Audit** — Inventory all agent definitions, measure token costs, identify optimization targets
2. **Optimize** — Apply optimizations per audit findings
3. **Validate** — Verify behavioral fidelity post-optimization
4. **Document** — Capture patterns and lessons learned
