## Summary

Conduct deep research into the Diataxis documentation framework to inform agent design, template creation, and quality criteria. Research covers the four quadrants (tutorials, how-to guides, reference, explanation), their boundaries, content characteristics, and practical application patterns.

**Technical Scope:**
- Diataxis framework theory and quadrant definitions
- Content characteristics and boundary rules per quadrant
- Practical application patterns for AI-assisted documentation
- Quality criteria and anti-patterns per quadrant

---

## Problem Statement

The Diataxis skill requires a thorough understanding of the framework's principles, quadrant boundaries, and quality criteria before agents can be designed. Without research, agent methodology would be based on incomplete understanding of Diataxis, leading to agents that produce documentation violating quadrant boundaries.

---

## Business Value

Research findings directly inform:
- Agent methodology sections (how each writer agent produces quadrant-specific content)
- Classification criteria (how the classifier determines document quadrant)
- Quality rubrics (how the auditor evaluates documentation against Diataxis standards)
- Template design (per-quadrant structural patterns)

### Features Unlocked

- FEAT-013-001: Core Writer Agents (agent methodology)
- FEAT-013-002: Classifier and Auditor Agents (classification criteria)
- EN-013-003: Per-Quadrant Templates (template structure)

---

## Technical Approach

1. Research Diataxis framework from primary sources (diataxis.fr)
2. Analyze quadrant characteristics, boundaries, and quality signals
3. Identify content patterns and anti-patterns per quadrant
4. Synthesize findings into actionable agent design inputs
5. Document in L0/L1/L2 research format

---

## Acceptance Criteria
