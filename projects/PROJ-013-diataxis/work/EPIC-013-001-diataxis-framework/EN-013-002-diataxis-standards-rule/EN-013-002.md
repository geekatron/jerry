## Summary

Create the canonical Diataxis standards rule file that governs writer agent behavior, defining quadrant characteristics, content boundaries, quality criteria, and anti-patterns. This rule file is loaded by all Diataxis agents and serves as the behavioral SSOT for the skill.

**Technical Scope:**
- Quadrant definitions with characteristics and boundaries
- Content rules per quadrant (HARD and MEDIUM)
- Quality criteria for classification and auditing
- Anti-patterns and boundary violations

---

## Problem Statement

Writer agents need a shared set of enforceable standards that define what constitutes correct Diataxis documentation. Without a standards rule file, each agent would independently interpret Diataxis principles, leading to inconsistent output and no shared quality baseline.

---

## Business Value

The standards rule file is the behavioral foundation for the entire Diataxis skill. All writer, classifier, and auditor agents reference it for:
- Quadrant boundary enforcement
- Content quality criteria
- Classification rules
- Audit rubrics

### Features Unlocked

- FEAT-013-001: Core Writer Agents (agents reference standards for methodology)
- FEAT-013-002: Classifier and Auditor Agents (agents reference standards for criteria)

---

## Technical Approach

1. Synthesize research findings (EN-013-001) into enforceable rules
2. Structure rules using HARD/MEDIUM/SOFT tier vocabulary per quality-enforcement.md
3. Define per-quadrant characteristics, content rules, and anti-patterns
4. Place at skills/diataxis/rules/diataxis-standards.md
5. Include navigation table per H-23

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Definition of Done

- [x] Rule file created at skills/diataxis/rules/diataxis-standards.md
- [x] All four quadrants defined with characteristics and boundaries
- [x] HARD and MEDIUM rules defined
- [x] Navigation table included per H-23
- [x] Anti-patterns documented per quadrant

|-------------|------|-------------|------|
| Diataxis Standards | Rule File | 5 sections covering all quadrants | [diataxis-standards.md](../../../../skills/diataxis/rules/diataxis-standards.md) |

### Verification

- [x] File exists at skills/diataxis/rules/diataxis-standards.md
- [x] 5 major sections present
- [x] Navigation table present per H-23
