## Summary

### Description

Implement the diataxis-classifier agent using the dual-file architecture per H-34. The agent analyzes existing documentation and classifies it into one or more Diataxis quadrants. It detects mixed-content documents and provides confidence scores for each quadrant classification. The classifier enables automatic routing of documentation requests to the appropriate writer agent.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `skills/diataxis/agents/diataxis-classifier.md` created with official Claude Code frontmatter
- [ ] `skills/diataxis/agents/diataxis-classifier.governance.yaml` created and validates against schema
- [ ] Constitutional compliance triplet (P-003, P-020, P-022) present in governance YAML
- [ ] Agent outputs quadrant classification with confidence score (0.0-1.0) per quadrant
- [ ] Agent detects mixed-content documents and identifies which sections belong to which quadrant
- [ ] Classification criteria align with diataxis-standards.md quadrant definitions

### Implementation Notes

- Cognitive mode: `convergent` (analysis, evaluation, classification)
- Tool tier: T1 (Read-Only) -- agent reads documents for classification, does not write
- Model recommendation: `sonnet` (balanced analysis)
