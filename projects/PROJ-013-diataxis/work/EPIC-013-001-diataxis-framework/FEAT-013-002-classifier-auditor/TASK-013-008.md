## Summary

### Description

Implement the diataxis-auditor agent using the dual-file architecture per H-34. The agent evaluates existing documentation against Diataxis standards, identifies quadrant boundary violations, and produces actionable findings with severity classification. The auditor enables systematic quality assessment and improvement of existing documentation.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `skills/diataxis/agents/diataxis-auditor.md` created with official Claude Code frontmatter
- [ ] `skills/diataxis/agents/diataxis-auditor.governance.yaml` created and validates against schema
- [ ] Constitutional compliance triplet (P-003, P-020, P-022) present in governance YAML
- [ ] Agent evaluates documents against diataxis-standards.md rules
- [ ] Agent produces findings in CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW severity format
- [ ] Agent identifies specific quadrant boundary violations with line-level references
- [ ] Agent provides actionable remediation suggestions per finding

### Implementation Notes

- Cognitive mode: `systematic` (checklist-driven evaluation)
- Tool tier: T1 (Read-Only) -- agent reads documents for audit, does not write
- Model recommendation: `sonnet` (structured evaluation task)
