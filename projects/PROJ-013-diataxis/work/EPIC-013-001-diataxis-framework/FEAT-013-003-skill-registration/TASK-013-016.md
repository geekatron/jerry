## Summary

### Description

Add a trigger map entry for `/diataxis` in `mandatory-skill-usage.md` using the 5-column enhanced format per agent-routing-standards.md. Define positive keywords, negative keywords, priority, compound triggers, and the skill target. Ensure no keyword collisions with existing skills (especially /problem-solving and /nasa-se).

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Trigger map entry added to mandatory-skill-usage.md for /diataxis
- [ ] 5-column format used: Detected Keywords, Negative Keywords, Priority, Compound Triggers, Skill
- [ ] Positive keywords include: diataxis, tutorial, how-to guide, reference doc, explanation doc, documentation framework, quadrant
- [ ] Negative keywords prevent collision with /problem-solving (research, analyze, investigate) and /nasa-se (requirements, specification)
- [ ] No false-positive routing for existing skills
- [ ] Priority number assigned consistent with existing priority ordering

### Implementation Notes

Proposed trigger map entry:
```
| diataxis, tutorial, how-to guide, reference doc, explanation doc, documentation framework, quadrant, write documentation, document type | research, analyze, investigate, requirements, specification, adversarial, transcript | 8 | "documentation framework" OR "write tutorial" OR "write how-to" (phrase match) | `/diataxis` |
```

Cross-reference against existing skills to verify no collisions.
