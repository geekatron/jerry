## Summary

Validate the complete Diataxis skill through governance schema validation, adversarial quality review, sample document production across all four quadrants, and dogfooding by improving existing Jerry documentation. This is the final quality gate before the skill is considered production-ready.

**Value Proposition:**
- Governance YAML validation ensures all agents meet H-34 structural requirements
- Adversarial review at >= 0.95 threshold ensures high-quality agent definitions
- Sample document production validates end-to-end agent behavior
- Improving existing docs proves real-world value

---

## Benefit Hypothesis

**We believe that** rigorous quality validation and real-world dogfooding

**Will result in** a production-ready skill that demonstrably improves documentation quality

**We will know we have succeeded when** all agents pass governance validation, adversarial review scores >= 0.95, and 2+ existing Jerry docs are measurably improved

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All agent `.governance.yaml` files validate against JSON Schema
- [ ] Adversarial quality review score >= 0.95 across all agents
- [ ] Sample documents produced for all 4 quadrants
- [ ] At least 2 existing Jerry documents improved using the skill
- [ ] All improvements pass adversarial review

### Functional Criteria

| # | Criterion | Verified |
|---|-----------|----------|
| AC-1 | Governance YAML validates for all 6 agents | [ ] |
| AC-2 | Adversarial quality review passes >= 0.95 | [ ] |
| AC-3 | Tutorial sample demonstrates learning-oriented content | [ ] |
| AC-4 | How-to sample demonstrates task-oriented content | [ ] |
| AC-5 | Reference sample demonstrates information-oriented content | [ ] |
| AC-6 | Explanation sample demonstrates understanding-oriented content | [ ] |
| AC-7 | 2+ existing Jerry docs improved with measurable quality gains | [ ] |
