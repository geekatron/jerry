## Summary

### Description

Dogfood the Diataxis skill by using it to improve at least 2 existing Jerry documentation files. First, use the diataxis-auditor to assess existing docs and identify quadrant violations. Then, use the appropriate writer agent to remediate the findings. This validates real-world utility and produces measurable documentation improvements.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least 2 existing Jerry docs selected for improvement
- [ ] diataxis-auditor run on each selected doc, findings documented
- [ ] Each doc improved using the appropriate writer agent
- [ ] Before/after comparison shows measurable quality improvement
- [ ] Improved docs pass diataxis-auditor re-assessment with reduced findings
- [ ] Improvements committed to the repository

### Implementation Notes

Candidate documents for improvement:
- `docs/knowledge/` files (may mix reference and explanation content)
- `.context/rules/` files (may mix how-to and reference content)
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` files (may benefit from clearer quadrant separation)
