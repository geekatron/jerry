## Summary

### Research Question

**Question:** What are the core principles, quadrant definitions, content boundaries, quality criteria, and practical application patterns of the Diataxis documentation framework, and how should they be encoded into Jerry writer agent methodology?

### Hypothesis

The Diataxis framework provides a well-defined taxonomy with clear quadrant boundaries that can be operationalized into agent-specific methodology sections, content rules, and quality rubrics.

### Timebox

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Timebox Duration | 2 hours |
| Start Date | 2026-02-27 |
| Target End Date | 2026-02-27 |

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Diataxis framework core theory (4 quadrants, 2 axes)
- Per-quadrant content characteristics and boundaries
- Quality criteria and anti-patterns per quadrant
- Practical application patterns for AI-assisted documentation
- Source material from diataxis.fr and secondary sources

**Out of Scope:**
- Implementation of agents (separate tasks)
- Template creation (separate enabler)
- Comparative analysis with other documentation frameworks

### Research Approach

1. Survey primary source (diataxis.fr) for framework theory
2. Analyze each quadrant's characteristics, boundaries, and quality signals
3. Identify cross-quadrant anti-patterns and boundary violations
4. Synthesize findings into actionable agent design inputs
5. Document with L0/L1/L2 progressive disclosure

## Findings

### Summary

The Diataxis framework organizes documentation along two axes (practical/theoretical, acquisition/application) into four quadrants with distinct content characteristics. Each quadrant has clear boundary rules that map directly to agent guardrails. The framework is well-suited for agent operationalization because its rules are explicit and verifiable.

### Key Findings

1. **Four quadrants are orthogonal:** Tutorials (learning-oriented), How-to guides (task-oriented), Reference (information-oriented), Explanation (understanding-oriented)
2. **Boundary violations are the primary quality problem:** Documents that mix quadrant concerns confuse readers
3. **Each quadrant has distinct structural patterns:** Step-by-step (tutorial), goal-focused (how-to), comprehensive tables (reference), conceptual narrative (explanation)
4. **Quality criteria are quadrant-specific:** What makes a good tutorial is different from what makes a good reference

### Evidence/References

## Recommendation

### Decision

Proceed with agent implementation using the research findings to inform per-quadrant methodology, guardrails, and output templates.

### Recommended Actions

1. Create standards rule file encoding quadrant boundaries (EN-013-002) -- DONE
2. Create per-quadrant templates (EN-013-003) -- PENDING
3. Implement 4 writer agents with quadrant-specific methodology (TASK-013-003 through TASK-013-006) -- PENDING
4. Implement classifier and auditor agents (TASK-013-007, TASK-013-008) -- PENDING
