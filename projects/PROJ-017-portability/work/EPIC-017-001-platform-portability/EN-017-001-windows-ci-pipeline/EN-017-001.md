## Summary

Add a Windows runner to the GitHub Actions CI pipeline to catch platform-specific failures before merge. Currently all CI runs on Ubuntu only, so Windows portability bugs are only discovered post-merge.

---

## Problem Statement

All portability bugs in PROJ-017 were discovered through manual analysis (PORT-001), not CI. Without a Windows CI runner, platform-specific regressions can be introduced silently. The current Ubuntu-only pipeline provides zero Windows coverage.

---

## Business Value

- **Prevents regression:** Catches Windows-specific failures automatically on every PR
- **Enables confidence:** Contributors can verify cross-platform compatibility without manual testing
- **Unblocks bug fixes:** Bug fixes for BUG-017-001 through BUG-017-005 need CI validation

---

## Technical Approach

1. Add `windows-latest` runner to existing GitHub Actions CI workflow
2. Configure `uv` installation for Windows in CI
3. Run test suite on Windows runner
4. Add platform-specific test markers (e.g., `@pytest.mark.windows`)
5. Ensure CI matrix covers both Ubuntu and Windows

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Definition of Done

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow includes `windows-latest` runner
- [ ] `uv sync` and `uv run pytest` execute successfully on Windows CI
- [ ] CI matrix runs on both Ubuntu and Windows for every PR
- [ ] Platform-specific test failures are visible in CI output
- [ ] CI pipeline documented in contributing guide
