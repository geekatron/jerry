## Summary

Migration scripts in `scripts/migrations/` use bash shell syntax (`#!/bin/bash`, bash-specific constructs) making them non-executable on Windows without WSL or Git Bash.

**Key Details:**
- **Symptom:** Migration scripts fail to execute on Windows; `bash: command not found`
- **Frequency:** Every migration attempt on Windows
- **Workaround:** Run migrations manually or use WSL

---

## Steps to Reproduce

### Prerequisites

- Windows machine without WSL/Git Bash in PATH
- Jerry repository with pending migrations

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone jerry repository on Windows
2. Attempt to run a migration script from `scripts/migrations/`
3. Observe failure due to bash not being available

### Expected Result

Migration scripts execute successfully using available Python runtime.

### Actual Result

Scripts fail because they require bash, which is not available on standard Windows.

## Environment

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Operating System** | Windows 10/11 |
| **Runtime** | Python 3.11+ |
| **Application Version** | Jerry v0.21.0 |
| **Configuration** | `scripts/migrations/*.sh` |

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Fix Verification

- [ ] Migration scripts rewritten as Python scripts (`.py`) or use `subprocess` with `sys.executable`
- [ ] Migrations execute on Windows, macOS, and Linux via `uv run python scripts/migrations/...`
- [ ] No regression: existing migrations still produce correct results
- [ ] Migration runner (if any) updated to invoke Python scripts
