## L0: Executive Summary

### Key Findings

Knowledge Management (KM) has matured from a vague business concept into a discipline with international standards (ISO 30401:2018), established frameworks (APQC), maturity models (Siemens KMMM, APQC), and proven operational protocols (After Action Reviews, Knowledge Audits). This research synthesizes six standards, six protocols, and strategic decision frameworks to guide KM implementation.

### Critical Insights

1. **Standards Evolution**: ISO 30401:2018 represents the first time ISO recognized knowledge as a formal organizational resource requiring systematic management
2. **Protocol Selection is Context-Dependent**: No single protocol fits all scenarios; selection depends on knowledge type (tacit vs. explicit), organizational maturity, and strategic goals
3. **The Codification-Personalization Trade-off**: Organizations must balance document-based knowledge capture (codification) with people-based knowledge sharing (personalization), typically in an 80-20 split aligned with competitive strategy
4. **Maturity Models Provide Roadmaps**: Multiple maturity models exist (APQC, Siemens KMMM, Infosys) with similar 5-stage progressions from ad-hoc to optimizing
5. **Metadata Standards Enable Interoperability**: Dublin Core and SKOS provide lightweight, standardized vocabularies for knowledge organization across systems

### Recommended Actions for Jerry Framework

1. **Immediate**: Implement After Action Reviews (AARs) for completed work items to capture lessons learned
2. **Short-term**: Conduct initial Knowledge Audit to assess current knowledge assets and flows
3. **Medium-term**: Develop knowledge maps linking documentation to expertise areas
4. **Long-term**: Pursue ISO 30401:2018 alignment for systematic KM maturity

### Trade-off Analysis: Codification vs. Personalization for Jerry

#### The Core Strategic Choice

**Codification Strategy** (People → Documents):
- Capture, codify, store, disseminate, reuse explicit knowledge
- Emphasizes knowledge bases, documentation, templates
- Scales well, accessible 24/7

**Personalization Strategy** (People → People):
- Facilitate knowledge transfer through relationships
- Emphasizes mentoring, communities, storytelling
- Rich tacit knowledge transfer

#### Jerry's Context

**Competitive Strategy**: Systematic problem-solving through documented processes
**Product Type**: Structured workflows with accumulated knowledge
**Innovation Level**: Moderate (methodological innovation, not radical invention)
**Knowledge Nature**: Mix of explicit (processes, frameworks) and tacit (agent tuning, prompt engineering)

#### Recommended Balance: **70% Codification / 30% Personalization**

**Rationale**:
- Jerry emphasizes **file persistence** (P-002 in Constitution)
- Ephemeral agent sessions require documented knowledge
- Processes and frameworks are highly codifiable
- BUT: Agent tuning and skill development require experimentation (tacit)

**Codification Elements (70%)**:
- Process documentation (`docs/knowledge/`)
- Agent definitions (`.claude/agents/`)
- ADRs and design decisions (`docs/design/`)
- Research reports (`docs/research/`)
- Templates and skills (`skills/`)

**Personalization Elements (30%)**:
- User-agent interaction refinement
- Skill development through experimentation
- Prompt engineering tacit knowledge
- Community of practice (future: Jerry users)
- Oral tradition through `docs/wisdom/` narratives

**Implementation**:
- Primary: Comprehensive documentation (codification)
- Secondary: Capture tacit insights in `docs/wisdom/` and `docs/experience/`
- Balance: Document processes, but encourage experimentation and adaptation
