Total enforcement budget: ~15,100 tokens (7.6% of 200K context).</p> </li> <li> <p>Workflow Orchestration -- Coordinate multi-phase, multi-agent workflows with persistent state tracking. Fan-out parallel work, synchronize at barriers, and resume across sessions with checkpoint recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p>Knowledge Persistence -- Every skill invocation produces a persisted artifact on disk (research, analysis, decisions, reviews). These survive session boundaries and context compaction, building a cumulative project knowledge base.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quality Enforcement -- A quantitative quality gate (&gt;= 0.92 weighted composite score) with a creator-critic-revision cycle (minimum 3 iterations). Six scoring dimensions (Completeness, Internal Consistency, Methodological Rigor, Evidence Quality, Actionability, Traceability) with calibrated weights ensure deliverables meet a consistent standard before acceptance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adversarial Review -- Ten adversarial strategies across 4 families (Iterative Self-Correction, Dialectical Synthesis, Role-Based Adversarialism, Structured Decomposition) applied at 4 criticality levels (C1 Routine through C4 Critical tournament review with all 10 strategies).</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#why-jerry","title":"Why Jerry?","text":"<p>Your context window is not infinite.

Claude Code uses the word \"marketplace\" in its <code>/plugin marketplace</code> commands, but for community plugins like Jerry, it just means \"register a plugin source.\" Any GitHub repository with a <code>.claude-plugin/marketplace.json</code> file can serve as a plugin source. Jerry's GitHub repository is its own marketplace. This is separate from the official Anthropic marketplace, which is automatically available in Claude Code and contains Anthropic-curated plugins.</p> <p>Where do I type these commands?

That's the dangerous part. At their core, these models predict the next token based on everything before it. Post-training techniques like RLHF shape that behavior, but when your instructions leave room for interpretation, the prediction mechanism fills the gaps with whatever pattern showed up most often in the training data. Not what's actually true about your repo. The output comes back with clean structure, professional headings, and authoritative language. Reads like an expert wrote it.</p> <p>Except the expert part is a mirage. I call it the fluency-competence gap. Bender and Koller (2020) showed that models learn to sound like they understand without actually understanding. Sharma et al. (2024) found that RLHF, the technique used to make models helpful, actually makes this worse by rewarding confident-sounding responses over accurate ones.

You've gone from \"generate whatever\" to \"generate something that meets specific constraints.\" That matters at the architecture level. Specific instructions narrow the space of outputs the model considers acceptable. Vague instructions let it fill in every blank with defaults. Wei et al.

When phases build on each other. When getting it wrong in phase one means everything after it looks authoritative but is structurally broken. That's when you go further:</p> <p>\"Do two things in parallel: gap analysis on this repo, and research the top 10 industry frameworks using real sources, not training data. Narrow to 5 based on [specific constraints]. Cross-pollinate the findings. I need citations and references. Critique your own work before showing me. Score yourself on completeness, consistency, and evidence quality. Three revision passes minimum. Insert checkpoints where I review before you continue. Show me the execution plan before you do anything.\"</p> <p>That Level 3 prompt assumes a model with tool access: file system, web search, the works. If you're in a plain chat window, paste the relevant code and verify citations yourself. Same principles, different mechanics.</p> <p>Same ask as Level 1. Frameworks applied to a repo. But now the model knows:</p> <ul> <li>Why two work streams instead of one pass? Because gap analysis and framework research pull in different directions. Separate them, and each gets the attention it needs.</li> <li>You want grounded evidence, not pattern completion from training data. The evidence constraint forces the model to look outward instead of interpolating from what it already \"knows.\"</li> <li>Self-critique against dimensions you defined. Not the model's own vague sense of \"good enough,\" but completeness, consistency, and evidence quality as you specified them.</li> <li>Here's the tension with that self-critique step. I just told the model to evaluate its own work, but models genuinely struggle with self-assessment. Panickssery et al. (2024) showed that LLMs recognize and favor their own output, consistently rating it higher than external evaluators do. Self-critique in the prompt is still useful as a first pass, a way to catch obvious gaps. But it's not a substitute for your eyes on the output. The human checkpoints are where real quality control happens.</li> <li>And plan before product. You evaluate the process before committing to the output.</li> </ul> <p>One more thing that bites hard: once bad output enters a multi-phase pipeline, it doesn't just persist. It compounds. This is a well-established pattern in pipeline design, and it hits LLM workflows especially hard. Each downstream phase takes the previous output at face value and adds another layer of polished-sounding analysis on top. By phase three, the whole thing looks authoritative. The errors are structural. It's not garbage in, garbage out. It's garbage in, increasingly polished garbage out, and it gets much harder to tell the difference the deeper into the pipeline you go. The human checkpoints catch this. Reviewing the plan catches it earlier.</p>"},{"location":"blog/why-structured-prompting-works/#the-two-session-pattern","title":"The Two-Session Pattern","text":"<p>Here's the move most people miss entirely.</p> <p>You don't fire off that big prompt and let the model run. You review the plan it gives you. You iterate on it. Push back. Because when instructions leave room for interpretation, the model defaults to the most probable completion, which almost always means the most generic, least rigorous version that technically satisfies what you asked. If you don't push back on the plan, everything downstream inherits that mediocrity.</p> <p>So you review, you get the plan tight. Then you do something counterintuitive: start a brand new conversation. Copy the finalized plan into a fresh chat and give it one clean instruction: \"You are the executor. Here is the plan. Follow it step by step. Flag deviations rather than freelancing.\"</p> <p>Why a new conversation? Two reasons.</p> <p>First, the context window is finite. Every token from your planning conversation is taking up space that should be used for execution. Liu et al. (2024) found that models pay the most attention to what's at the beginning and end of a long context, and significantly less to everything in the middle. They studied retrieval tasks, but the attentional pattern applies here too: your carefully crafted instructions from message three are competing with forty messages of planning debate, and the model isn't weighing them evenly.</p> <p>Second, planning and execution are different jobs. A clean context lets the model focus on one thing instead of carrying all the noise from the planning debate.</p> <p>You do lose the back-and-forth nuance. That's real. The plan artifact has to carry the full context on its own. Phases, what \"done\" looks like for each phase, output format. If the plan can't stand alone, it wasn't detailed enough. Which is exactly why the review step matters.</p>"},{"location":"blog/why-structured-prompting-works/#why-this-works-on-every-model","title":"Why This Works on Every Model","text":"<p>You know what none of this requires? A specific vendor. Context windows are engineering constraints, the kind of hard limits determined by architecture and compute. They've grown fast: GPT-3 shipped with 2K tokens in 2020, and Gemini 1.5 crossed a million in 2024. But within any given model, the ceiling is fixed, and you're working inside it. Every model performs better when you give it structure to work with. Tell it exactly what to do instead of hoping for the best. Give it quality criteria instead of \"use your best judgment.\" Require evidence instead of letting it free-associate. That finding holds across models, tasks, and research groups.</p> <p>The principles are universal. The syntax varies. XML tags for Claude, markdown for GPT, whatever the model prefers. The structure is what matters, not the format.</p>"},{"location":"blog/why-structured-prompting-works/#the-three-principles","title":"The Three Principles","text":"<p>Constrain the work. Don't tell the model what topic to explore. Tell it what to do, how to show its reasoning, and how you'll evaluate the result. Every dimension you leave open, the model fills with its default, driven by probability distributions rather than any understanding of what you actually need.</p> <p>Review the plan before the product. Get the execution plan first. Does it have real phases? Does it define what \"done\" means for each one? Does it include quality checks? If the plan is basically \"step 1: do it, step 2: we're done,\" push back. The plan is where you catch bad thinking before it multiplies.</p> <p>Separate planning from execution. Plan in one conversation, execute in a fresh one with just the finalized artifact. Don't drag 40 messages of planning debate into the execution context. Clean slate, focused execution.</p>"},{"location":"blog/why-structured-prompting-works/#when-this-breaks","title":"When This Breaks","text":"<p>Structured prompting is not a magic fix. Sometimes you write a beautifully constrained prompt and the model hallucinates a source that doesn't exist, or applies a framework to the wrong part of your codebase, or confidently delivers something internally consistent and completely wrong. Structure reduces the frequency of those failures. It doesn't eliminate them. If the task is exploratory, if you're brainstorming, if you're writing something where constraint kills the creative output, back off the structure. And if you've tried three revision passes and the output still isn't landing, the problem might not be your prompt. It might be the task exceeding what a single context window can hold. That's when you decompose the work, not add more instructions to an already-overloaded conversation.</p>"},{"location":"blog/why-structured-prompting-works/#start-here","title":"Start Here","text":"<p>Your Level 2 baseline. Get these three right and you'll see the difference immediately:</p> <ul> <li> Did I specify WHAT to do (not just the topic)?</li> <li> Did I tell it HOW I'll judge quality?</li> <li> Did I require evidence or sources?</li> </ul> <p>When you're ready for Level 3, add these two:</p> <ul> <li> Did I ask for the plan BEFORE the product?</li> <li> Am I in a clean context (or carrying planning baggage)?</li> </ul> <p>You don't need to go full orchestration right away. Just adding \"show me your plan before you execute, and cite your sources\" to any prompt will change what you get back. Start with Level 2.

The preparation was everything underneath it.</p> <p>Next time you open an LLM, before you type anything, write down three things: what you need, how you'll know if it's good, and what you want to see first.

When a model trains on documents from multiple time periods, it acquires multiple contradictory snapshots of the same fact.

Each makes factual claims that were true at the time of writing but may not be true at any other time. The model compresses these contradictory snapshots into a single internal representation \u2014 and the compression produces characteristic errors:</p> <ul> <li>Version number errors: The model selects a plausible blend of the snapshots, but it may not correspond to any actual version</li> <li>API behavior errors: The model describes behavior from one version while claiming to describe a different version</li> <li>Dependency errors: The model describes a dependency relationship from one snapshot while referencing a version from another</li> </ul> <p>The severity of the Snapshot Problem varies by how frequently the underlying facts change:</p> Stability Description Domains Snapshot Conflict Rate Immutable Facts never change Fundamental science, mathematics, established history Near zero Slow-evolving Facts change on decade timescales Geography, demographics, medical consensus Low Medium-evolving Facts change on year timescales Pop culture counts, sports records, political geography Moderate Fast-evolving Facts change on month/week timescales Software versions, API details, current events High Ephemeral Facts change continuously Stock prices, weather, live scores Not addressable by training data <p>The critical insight: The Snapshot Problem is not fixable by better training alone.

Then it stated that Session objects were introduced in version 1.0.0.</p> <p>They were introduced in version 0.6.0.</p> <p>The error is embedded in a paragraph of correct information. It is stated with the same confidence as the correct claims. A developer reading this answer would have no reason to question it unless they independently checked the PyPI release history. The surrounding accuracy creates trust. The specific error rides that trust into the developer's mental model.</p> <p>This is not hallucination. The model did not invent a topic.

And why is it worse for some domains than others?</p> <p>Training data captures the state of the world at the time each document was written. A model trained on web text from 2019 through 2024 has seen the Python <code>requests</code> library described at version 2.22, 2.24, 2.26, 2.28, and 2.31 -- each described as \"the current version\" in its respective document.</p> <p>The model compresses these contradictory snapshots into a single internal representation. It has no mechanism to determine which snapshot is most recent. It picks a version number that is plausible but may not correspond to any actual state of the library.</p> <p>This is the Snapshot Problem: training data captures point-in-time facts as permanent truths, and the model has no way to resolve conflicts between snapshots from different time periods.</p> <p>The Snapshot Problem explains the domain hierarchy:</p> Domain Why It's Reliable (or Not) Science/Medicine (95% FA, 0% CIR) Facts are stable across time. The boiling point of ethanol is the same in every training document. Every source agrees. History/Geography (92.5% FA, 5% CIR) Most facts are stable, but specific dates can vary across sources. A model might absorb \"2006\" from one source when the actual date was late 2005. Pop Culture (85% FA, 7.5% CIR) Extensive data but with inconsistencies in counts, awards, and credits. Training data from different years lists different MCU phase compositions. Sports (82.5% FA, 5% CIR) Good general coverage but specific records and achievements are often conflated across similar athletes or events. Technology (70% FA, 17.5% CIR) The worst domain by far. Version numbers, API details, and dependencies change constantly. Every training snapshot describes a different \"current\" state. The model is confident because it has seen the topic extensively. It is wrong because the snapshots contradict each other. <p>When training data is abundant and consistent, the model is reliable. When training data is abundant but inconsistent, the model is confidently unreliable. Volume creates confidence. Consistency creates accuracy. Technology has volume without consistency.</p>"},{"location":"research/llm-deception/the-85-problem/#the-tool-augmented-agent","title":"The Tool-Augmented Agent","text":"<p>Agent B -- the same model with web search -- scored 93% on in-training-set questions and 87% on post-cutoff questions.

It also catches the confident micro-inaccuracies in the training data (Leg 1).</p> <p>The fix is not better prompting. Telling the model to \"be careful\" or \"only state what you're sure about\" does not work because the model cannot distinguish what it knows correctly from what it knows incorrectly.
