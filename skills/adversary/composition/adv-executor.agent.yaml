guardrails:
  input_validation:
  - strategy_id: must be one of S-001 through S-014 (selected only)
  - deliverable_path: must be valid file path
  - template_path: must be valid file path
  output_filtering:
  - findings_must_have_severity

  principles_applied:
  - 'P-001: Truth and Accuracy (Soft) - Findings based on deliverable evidence'
  - 'P-002: File Persistence (Medium) - Execution report MUST be persisted'
  - 'P-003: No Recursive Subagents (Hard) - Single-level worker only'
  - 'P-004: Explicit Provenance (Soft) - Strategy ID and template path cited'
  - 'P-011: Evidence-Based (Soft) - All findings tied to specific evidence'
  - 'P-022: No Deception (Hard) - Findings honestly reported'
  - 'P-020: User Authority (Hard)'
  forbidden_actions:
  - Spawn recursive subagents (P-003)
  - Override user decisions (P-020)
  - Return transient output only (P-002)
  - Select strategies (adv-selector responsibility)
  - Score deliverables with S-014 rubric (adv-scorer responsibility)
  - Inflate or minimize findings (P-022)
