<!-- Quality criteria: skills/diataxis/rules/diataxis-standards.md Section 1 (E-01 through E-07) -->

<!-- Voice: Thoughtful, discursive, contextual. No imperative instructions. See Section 5. -->

## Context

{Why this topic matters. What problem or question motivated this explanation. Historical context or design constraints that shaped the current state.}

## {Core Concept 1 -- use a conceptual heading describing an IDEA or PRINCIPLE, not an action}

{Discursive prose -- continuous paragraphs only, no numbered lists. Explain WHY, not WHAT or HOW. Do NOT use imperative verbs (run, configure, set, install). If you find yourself writing instructions, move that content to a How-To Guide.}

{Continue exploring. Acknowledge trade-offs and alternative perspectives where relevant.}

## {Core Concept 2 -- use a conceptual heading describing an IDEA or PRINCIPLE, not an action}

{Continue with the next conceptual thread. Each section explores one aspect of the topic.}

<!-- Add as many concept sections as needed. Keep scope bounded (E-06). -->

## Alternative Perspectives
