# How to {achieve goal}

> {One-sentence description of the goal this guide helps you achieve.}

<!-- Quality criteria: skills/diataxis/rules/diataxis-standards.md Section 1 (H-01 through H-07) -->
<!-- Anti-patterns to avoid: HAP-01 (conflating with tutorial), HAP-04 (completeness over focus -- one real-world variation satisfies H-03 without triggering HAP-04) -->
<!-- Voice: Direct, action-oriented, efficient. No explanatory paragraphs between steps. See Section 5. -->
<!-- H-02/H-03 compatibility: Conditional branches ("If you need X, do Y") are action content, not explanation. -->

## Before You Begin

You need:
- {Prerequisite 1}
- {Prerequisite 2}

## Steps

### 1. {Imperative verb + object — e.g., "Configure the database connection"}

{Direct instruction. No explanation of why.}

```
{command or code}
```

### 2. {Imperative verb + object — e.g., "Deploy the service"}

{Direct instruction.}

If you need {variation A}:

```
{alternative command}
```

If you need {variation B}:

```
{alternative command}
```

<!-- HAP-04 guard: Include at most one "If you need X, do Y" conditional per step. Additional conditionals suggest the step should be split or the variations documented in separate guides. -->

### 3. {Imperative verb + object}

{Direct instruction. No explanation of why.}

```
{command or code}
```

<!-- Add as many steps as needed. Keep each step focused on a single action. -->
<!-- HAP-04 guard: Include at most one "If you need X, do Y" conditional per step. Additional conditionals suggest the step should be split or the variations documented in separate guides. -->

## Verification

Confirm the goal is achieved:

```
{verification command}
```

Expected result: {specific, observable output -- e.g., exit code 0, HTTP 200 response, log line "Started successfully". Must be confirmable without judgment.}
