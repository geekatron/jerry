# Learn to {skill} by {activity}

> {One-sentence description of what the reader will have built, configured, or created by the end -- state a concrete, observable artifact, not an abstract skill.}

<!-- Quality criteria: skills/diataxis/rules/diataxis-standards.md Section 1 (T-01 through T-08) -->

<!-- Voice: Encouraging, concrete, collaborative. See Section 5 of diataxis-standards.md. -->

## What You Will Achieve

By the end of this tutorial, you will have:
- {Concrete outcome 1}
- {Concrete outcome 2}

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you need:
- {Tool or software requirement}
- {Knowledge requirement}
- {Access requirement}

## Steps

<!-- Add as many steps as needed. Most tutorials require 5-10 steps. Each step MUST have a visible result (T-02). -->
<!-- Do NOT offer alternatives within steps (TAP-03). Present exactly one path. -->
<!-- T-08: Author must verify steps produce documented results, or flag unverified steps with [UNTESTED]. -->

### 1. {First action}

{Brief instruction. One path only — no "alternatively" or "you could also."}

```
{command or code}
```

**Expected result:** {What the reader should observe — terminal output, file change, UI state, or confirmation message.}

### 2. {Second action}

<!-- Do NOT offer alternatives within steps (TAP-03). Present exactly one path. -->

{Brief instruction.}

```
{command or code}
```

**Expected result:** {Observable outcome.}

### 3. {Third action}

<!-- Do NOT offer alternatives within steps (TAP-03). Present exactly one path. -->

{Brief instruction.}

```
{command or code}
```

**Expected result:** {Observable outcome.}

<!-- Continue adding steps as needed. Do not stop at 3 if the tutorial requires more. -->

## What You Learned

You now know how to:
- {Observable skill 1 -- e.g., "create a {resource} using the `{tool command}` command"}
- {Observable skill 2 -- e.g., "verify {resource} status by running `{verification command}`"}
