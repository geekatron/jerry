## Usage Notes

1. **Early phase focus** - This template is for Pre-Phase A / Phase A when exploring possibilities
2. **Vision over details** - Focus on what could be, not detailed specifications
3. **Feasibility sketches** - Quick assessments, not rigorous analysis
4. **Capture uncertainty** - Document what we don't know as valuable output
5. **Enable progression** - Each concept should have a path forward

## Exploration Techniques

When exploring concepts, consider:
- **Morphological analysis:** Decompose into parameters, explore combinations
- **Analogies:** How have others solved similar problems?
- **Extremes:** What would the most ambitious version look like?
- **Constraints:** What if key constraints were removed?
- **Time horizons:** What's possible now vs. 5 years vs. 10 years?

## Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)

| TRL | Definition | Concept Phase |
|-----|------------|---------------|
| 1 | Basic principles observed | Early exploration |
| 2 | Technology concept formulated | Exploration |

| 6 | System demonstration in environment | Development |
| 7 | System prototype in operations | Late development |
| 8 | System complete and qualified | Ready |
| 9 | System proven in operations | Operational |
