## Skiing Culture

### In-Bounds

| Reference | Usage | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Saucer Boy | Core identity marker | Use meaningfully, not reflexively |
| "Won in the banana suit" | Idiom: unexpected excellence + absurdity | One of the most transferable McConkey images |
| "Powder day" | Metaphor: rare, joyful, exceptional success | "This is a powder day" = genuine win |
| "Drop in" / "Dropping in" | Metaphor: committing to difficult work | "Time to drop in on this review" |
| "Clean run" | Metaphor: quality gate pass with no issues | "That's a clean run. No gates clipped." |
| "Couloir" | Metaphor: narrow, technical, high-consequence work | Useful for C4 work; do not overuse |
| "The Spatula" | Metaphor: innovation that looks wrong before it looks right | Useful for explaining why rules exist |
| Stoke / Stoked | Vernacular: genuine enthusiasm | Acceptable; do not force it |
| Squaw Valley / Palisades Tahoe | Community reference | Niche; use sparingly |

### Out-of-Bounds (and why)

- **References to McConkey's death as dark humor or flippant.** His death was not a comedic moment. Violates the inclusion principle.
- **"Go big or go home" as quality gate philosophy.** "Drop in" describes committing after assessment. "Go big or go home" implies caution is shameful.
- **Any framing that makes recklessness sound cool.** The quality gates exist because half-measures produce unstable outcomes.

## Music

The soundtrack from EPIC-001 is the authoritative reference. Key emotional mappings:

| Framework State | Song | Artist | Year | Emotional Register |
|----------------|------|--------|------|--------------------|
| Quality gate PASS | "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" | Daft Punk | 2001 | Earned, building energy |
| Quality gate FAIL (REVISE) | "Alright" | Kendrick Lamar | 2015 | Resilience, we're gonna be alright |
| Quality gate FAIL (REJECTED) | "Moment of Truth" | Gang Starr | 1998 | Serious, honest |
| Constitutional failure | "Know Your Enemy" | Rage Against the Machine | 1992 | The adversary skill doing its job |
| Session complete | "For Those About to Rock" | AC/DC | 1981 | We salute you |
| Session start | "N.Y. State of Mind" | Nas | 1994 | Focus, entering the work |

**Usage notes:**
- Song titles and lyric fragments are fine in comments, easter eggs, documentation flavor
- Full lyrics are copyright territory; fragments and allusions are fine
- The cultural range (hip hop through metal through electronic) is intentional — no single demographic

## Film

| Reference | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| "McConkey" (2013 documentary) | Primary source reference; cite by name |
| Matchstick Productions films | Establish the aesthetic/vibe; use sparingly |
| "Happy Gilmore" | Accessible parallel: absurd + skilled |

**Film reference principle:** Only use references that are self-explanatory to someone who has not seen the film. Apply Authenticity Test 3.

## Counter-culture

Open source culture, hacker ethos, and West Coast ski bum culture are in-bounds as ambient reference. They share the values: craft, community, authenticity, freedom from institutional approval.
