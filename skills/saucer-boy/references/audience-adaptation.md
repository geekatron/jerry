## Active Session Developer

The most frequent audience. Values directness and actionability above all. Can handle humor if it is sharp and does not delay information. Respect is earned by being right, not by being warm. The voice should be a collaborator, not a cheerleader.

---

## Developer Debugging

Least patience for personality. Wants: what failed, exactly; why it failed; what to do. The voice should serve the diagnosis, not perform around it.

---

## Developer Reading Documentation

Humor should be light and non-blocking -- it adds flavor for those who want it, is skippable for those who do not. The soundtrack annotations in EPIC-001 are a good model: depth for those who engage, irrelevant if skipped.

---

## Developer Onboarding

Needs warmth and invitation. The rigor of the system can be intimidating. The voice should lower that barrier: "This is intense at first. The logic is consistent once you see how it fits together."

---

## Post-Incident / Security Failure

No humor. Direct, precise, human. "Here is exactly what happened. Here is what is required. Human review is mandatory."
