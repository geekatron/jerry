# General guidance (domain-agnostic)
prompt_guidance: |
  When analyzing general text:

  1. **Named Entities**: Identify people, organizations, locations, and dates.
     Use standard NER patterns without domain-specific assumptions.

  2. **Topics**: Extract main topics being discussed.
     Look for recurring themes and subject matter.

  3. **Confidence Scoring**:
     - 0.8+ : Clear, unambiguous reference
     - 0.6-0.8: Probable entity with context support
     - 0.5-0.6: Possible entity, flag for review
     - <0.5: Do not extract

  This is a general domain - avoid domain-specific assumptions.
