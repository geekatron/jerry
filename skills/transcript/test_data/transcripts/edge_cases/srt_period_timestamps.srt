00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
[Alice] Welcome to the design review session.

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.500
[Bob] Thanks Alice. I have the diagrams ready.

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.750
[Alice] Great. Let's walk through the architecture.

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.000
[Charlie] I have some questions about the data flow.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.500
[Bob] Sure, let me explain. The data flows from
the ingestion layer to the processing pipeline.

6
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.000
[Alice] And the storage layer handles persistence.
We use event sourcing for audit trails.
