1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
[Alice] Good morning everyone. Let's start our daily standup.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:12,000
[Alice] Bob, would you like to kick us off with your update?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:25,500
[Bob] Sure. Yesterday I finished the API authentication module. Today I'll work on the database migration scripts. No blockers for me.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,000
[Alice] Great progress on the auth module. Charlie, you're up next.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:52,000
[Charlie] Yesterday I completed the login form UI. I'm waiting on Bob's API to test the integration. Today I need to implement the password reset flow.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:05,000
[Bob] The authentication endpoints are ready. I'll send you the Swagger documentation after this meeting.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
[Charlie] Perfect, that will unblock me. Thanks Bob.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:25,000
[Alice] Diana, how is the test planning going?

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:48,000
[Diana] I've drafted the test cases for the authentication flow. I need to review them with the team. Can we schedule a test case review session this week?

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:05,000
[Alice] Good question. Let's go with Thursday afternoon for the review. Does that work for everyone?

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
[Bob] Thursday works for me.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
[Charlie] I'm free Thursday afternoon.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
[Diana] Perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:45,000
[Alice] Before we wrap up, we need to discuss the deployment timeline. The stakeholders are asking about the release date.

15
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:05,000
[Bob] Based on current progress, I think we can have the backend ready by next Friday. The migration will need a weekend window though.

16
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:22,000
[Charlie] The frontend should be ready by Wednesday if the API integration goes smoothly today.

17
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:40,000
[Diana] I'll need at least three days for regression testing after integration. So if integration completes Wednesday, I can finish testing by Monday.

18
00:03:40,000 --> 00:04:00,000
[Alice] So we're looking at a Monday release. We decided to target Monday the 15th for production deployment.

19
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:18,000
[Bob] Sounds good. I will prepare the rollback scripts as a safety measure. That's assigned to me for tomorrow.

20
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:35,000
[Alice] Excellent. Charlie, can you work with Diana to create a smoke test checklist for the deployment?

21
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:45,000
[Charlie] Will do. Diana, let's sync after this meeting.

22
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
[Diana] Agreed. I'll block some time on our calendars.

23
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:10,000
[Alice] One more thing. How do we want to handle the feature flag for the new authentication? Should we do a gradual rollout?

24
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:32,000
[Bob] I recommend a phased approach. We can start with internal users, then expand to 10% of production traffic.

25
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:45,000
[Diana] That aligns with our testing strategy. We agreed to use the phased rollout approach.

26
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
[Alice] Perfect. I'll update the release plan document with these decisions.

27
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
[Charlie] Quick question - what about the legacy login endpoint? Are we deprecating it immediately?

28
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:35,000
[Bob] We should keep it running in parallel for at least two weeks. I need to add deprecation warnings to the API response headers.

29
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:48,000
[Alice] Good thinking. Add that to your task list, Bob.

30
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
[Bob] Already on it. I'll create the ticket after this meeting.

31
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:10,000
[Alice] Alright team, great discussion. Let's recap the action items.

32
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:25,000
[Alice] Bob will send API documentation to Charlie, prepare rollback scripts, and add deprecation warnings to the legacy endpoint.

33
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:38,000
[Alice] Charlie will implement password reset and work with Diana on the smoke test checklist.

34
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:50,000
[Alice] Diana will send the test review invite for Thursday and complete the test case documentation.

35
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
[Alice] And I'll update the release plan with our decisions. Any questions?

36
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
[Bob] All clear from my side.

37
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
[Charlie] Good to go.

38
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
[Diana] No questions here.

39
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:25,000
[Alice] Great work everyone. Let's have a productive day. Meeting adjourned.
