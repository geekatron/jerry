Alice: Good morning everyone. Let's start our daily standup.

Alice: Bob, would you like to kick us off with your update?

Bob: Sure. Yesterday I finished the API authentication module. Today I'll work on the database migration scripts. No blockers for me.

Alice: Great progress on the auth module. Charlie, you're up next.

Charlie: Yesterday I completed the login form UI. I'm waiting on Bob's API to test the integration. Today I need to implement the password reset flow.

Bob: The authentication endpoints are ready. I'll send you the Swagger documentation after this meeting.

Charlie: Perfect, that will unblock me. Thanks Bob.

Alice: Diana, how is the test planning going?

Diana: I've drafted the test cases for the authentication flow. I need to review them with the team. Can we schedule a test case review session this week?

Alice: Good question. Let's go with Thursday afternoon for the review. Does that work for everyone?

Bob: Thursday works for me.

Charlie: I'm free Thursday afternoon.

Diana: Perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.

Alice: Before we wrap up, we need to discuss the deployment timeline. The stakeholders are asking about the release date.

Bob: Based on current progress, I think we can have the backend ready by next Friday. The migration will need a weekend window though.

Charlie: The frontend should be ready by Wednesday if the API integration goes smoothly today.

Diana: I'll need at least three days for regression testing after integration. So if integration completes Wednesday, I can finish testing by Monday.

Alice: So we're looking at a Monday release. We decided to target Monday the 15th for production deployment.

Bob: Sounds good. I will prepare the rollback scripts as a safety measure. That's assigned to me for tomorrow.

Alice: Excellent. Charlie, can you work with Diana to create a smoke test checklist for the deployment?

Charlie: Will do. Diana, let's sync after this meeting.

Diana: Agreed. I'll block some time on our calendars.

Alice: One more thing. How do we want to handle the feature flag for the new authentication? Should we do a gradual rollout?

Bob: I recommend a phased approach. We can start with internal users, then expand to 10% of production traffic.

Diana: That aligns with our testing strategy. We agreed to use the phased rollout approach.

Alice: Perfect. I'll update the release plan document with these decisions.

Charlie: Quick question - what about the legacy login endpoint? Are we deprecating it immediately?

Bob: We should keep it running in parallel for at least two weeks. I need to add deprecation warnings to the API response headers.

Alice: Good thinking. Add that to your task list, Bob.

Bob: Already on it. I'll create the ticket after this meeting.

Alice: Alright team, great discussion. Let's recap the action items.

Alice: Bob will send API documentation to Charlie, prepare rollback scripts, and add deprecation warnings to the legacy endpoint.

Alice: Charlie will implement password reset and work with Diana on the smoke test checklist.

Alice: Diana will send the test review invite for Thursday and complete the test case documentation.

Alice: And I'll update the release plan with our decisions. Any questions?

Bob: All clear from my side.

Charlie: Good to go.

Diana: No questions here.

Alice: Great work everyone. Let's have a productive day. Meeting adjourned.
