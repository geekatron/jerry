00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
<v Alice>Good morning everyone. Let's start our daily standup.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Alice>Bob, would you like to kick us off with your update?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Bob>Sure. Yesterday I finished the API authentication module. Today I'll work on the database migration scripts. No blockers for me.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Alice>Great progress on the auth module. Charlie, you're up next.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:52.000
<v Charlie>Yesterday I completed the login form UI. I'm waiting on Bob's API to test the integration. Today I need to implement the password reset flow.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Bob>The authentication endpoints are ready. I'll send you the Swagger documentation after this meeting.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Charlie>Perfect, that will unblock me. Thanks Bob.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Alice>Diana, how is the test planning going?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Diana>I've drafted the test cases for the authentication flow. I need to review them with the team. Can we schedule a test case review session this week?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:05.000
<v Alice>Good question. Let's go with Thursday afternoon for the review. Does that work for everyone?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
<v Bob>Thursday works for me.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Charlie>I'm free Thursday afternoon.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
<v Diana>Perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:45.000
<v Alice>Before we wrap up, we need to discuss the deployment timeline. The stakeholders are asking about the release date.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:05.000
<v Bob>Based on current progress, I think we can have the backend ready by next Friday. The migration will need a weekend window though.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Charlie>The frontend should be ready by Wednesday if the API integration goes smoothly today.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Diana>I'll need at least three days for regression testing after integration. So if integration completes Wednesday, I can finish testing by Monday.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:04:00.000
<v Alice>So we're looking at a Monday release. We decided to target Monday the 15th for production deployment.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:18.000
<v Bob>Sounds good. I will prepare the rollback scripts as a safety measure. That's assigned to me for tomorrow.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:35.000
<v Alice>Excellent. Charlie, can you work with Diana to create a smoke test checklist for the deployment?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:45.000
<v Charlie>Will do. Diana, let's sync after this meeting.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Diana>Agreed. I'll block some time on our calendars.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Alice>One more thing. How do we want to handle the feature flag for the new authentication? Should we do a gradual rollout?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:32.000
<v Bob>I recommend a phased approach. We can start with internal users, then expand to 10% of production traffic.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:45.000
<v Diana>That aligns with our testing strategy. We agreed to use the phased rollout approach.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:06:00.000
<v Alice>Perfect. I'll update the release plan document with these decisions.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:15.000
<v Charlie>Quick question - what about the legacy login endpoint? Are we deprecating it immediately?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Bob>We should keep it running in parallel for at least two weeks. I need to add deprecation warnings to the API response headers.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:48.000
<v Alice>Good thinking. Add that to your task list, Bob.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000
<v Bob>Already on it. I'll create the ticket after this meeting.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:10.000
<v Alice>Alright team, great discussion. Let's recap the action items.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:25.000
<v Alice>Bob will send API documentation to Charlie, prepare rollback scripts, and add deprecation warnings to the legacy endpoint.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Alice>Charlie will implement password reset and work with Diana on the smoke test checklist.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Alice>Diana will send the test review invite for Thursday and complete the test case documentation.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:00.000
<v Alice>And I'll update the release plan with our decisions. Any questions?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
<v Bob>All clear from my side.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
<v Charlie>Good to go.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
<v Diana>No questions here.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:25.000
<v Alice>Great work everyone. Let's have a productive day. Meeting adjourned.
