NOTE
Golden dataset for ts-parser validation - EDGE CASES
Initial speakers: Alice, Bob, Charlie (3)
Late joins: Diana (5:00), Eve (10:00) → Total 5 speakers
W3C edge cases incorporated: voice tags with classes, multiline payloads,
nested formatting, entity escapes, unicode text
Duration: ~20 minutes

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.500
<v Alice>Let's start while we wait for others to join. We have three items on the agenda.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Bob>Sounds good. Should we record the meeting for those who join late?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Alice>Yes, recording has started. Diana &amp; Eve said they'll be a few minutes late.

NOTE Edge case: Multiline payload (ML-001, ML-002 from W3C research)

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Charlie>I wanted to discuss the API rate limiting issue.
We're seeing 429 errors during peak hours.
This affects about 15% of our users.

NOTE Edge case: Voice tag with class (VT-006, VT-007 from W3C research)

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:05.000
<v.urgent Bob>This is critical. We need to increase our rate limits or implement request queuing.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Alice>What's the current limit? I thought we increased it last sprint.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Charlie>Current limit is 100 requests per minute per user. Peak users hit this within 30 seconds.

NOTE Edge case: Nested formatting tags (TT-008 from W3C research)

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:10.000
<v Bob>The <b>rate limit</b> needs to be at least <i>200 requests per minute</i>. I'll implement the change.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Alice>We decided to increase the rate limit to 200 requests per minute.

NOTE Edge case: Entity escapes (CE-005, CE-006 from W3C research)

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:50.000
<v Charlie>We also need to document the X &lt; Y &lt; Z threshold logic. Users are confused about the limits.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Bob>True. The threshold formula is complex: if count &gt; 50 &amp;&amp; time &lt; 60 then throttle.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:30.000
<v Alice>Can someone update the developer documentation? I'll assign this to whoever has bandwidth.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:45.000
<v Charlie>I can take that. I'll update the docs this afternoon.

NOTE Edge case: Short timestamp without hours (TS-001 from W3C research)

03:45.000 --> 04:00.000
<v Alice>Moving to the second topic: database migration timeline.

04:00.000 --> 04:20.000
<v Bob>The migration script is ready. We need a maintenance window.

04:20.000 --> 04:45.000
<v Charlie>How long will the downtime be? Our SLA requires 99.9% uptime.

04:45.000 --> 05:05.000
<v Bob>Estimated 15 minutes. I've optimized the script to minimize downtime.

NOTE Edge case: Late joiner (Diana joins at 5:00)

05:05.000 --> 05:15.000
<v Alice>Diana just joined. Welcome Diana!

05:15.000 --> 05:35.000
<v Diana>Sorry I'm late. Traffic was terrible. What did I miss?

05:35.000 --> 06:00.000
<v Alice>We discussed rate limiting and are now on database migration. Bob is estimating 15 minutes downtime.

06:00.000 --> 06:20.000
<v Diana>15 minutes is acceptable for our SLA. Can we schedule it for Sunday 3 AM?

06:20.000 --> 06:40.000
<v Bob>Sunday 3 AM works. I'll prepare the rollback procedure as backup.

06:40.000 --> 06:55.000
<v Alice>We decided on Sunday 3 AM for the migration window.

NOTE Edge case: Voice tag without closing (VT-004 from W3C research)

06:55.000 --> 07:15.000
<v Charlie>Should we notify customers about the maintenance?

07:15.000 --> 07:40.000
<v Alice>Yes, I'll send the maintenance notification 48 hours in advance.

07:40.000 --> 08:05.000
<v Diana>I'll prepare a status page update. Can someone review it before I publish?

08:05.000 --> 08:20.000
<v Bob>I can review it. Send it to me by Friday.

NOTE Edge case: Multiple speakers in same cue (VT-009 from W3C research)

08:20.000 --> 08:50.000
<v Alice>Thanks Bob.</v> <v Diana>Thanks for taking that on.

08:50.000 --> 09:15.000
<v Charlie>Third topic: the mobile app performance issues.

09:15.000 --> 09:45.000
<v Bob>I've been profiling the app. The main bottleneck is the image loading. We need lazy loading.

09:45.000 --> 10:05.000
<v Diana>The QA team has received multiple complaints about slow loading on mobile.

NOTE Edge case: Second late joiner (Eve joins at 10:00)

10:05.000 --> 10:15.000
<v Alice>Eve just joined. Hi Eve!

10:15.000 --> 10:30.000
<v Eve>Hi everyone! Sorry for being late. I was stuck in another meeting.

10:30.000 --> 10:55.000
<v Alice>No problem. We're discussing mobile app performance. Bob identified image loading as the bottleneck.

10:55.000 --> 11:20.000
<v Eve>That makes sense. From an infrastructure perspective, we could add a CDN for images.

11:20.000 --> 11:45.000
<v Bob>Good idea. A CDN combined with lazy loading would significantly improve load times.

11:45.000 --> 12:05.000
<v Alice>We agreed to implement CDN and lazy loading for mobile performance.

NOTE Edge case: Unicode/international characters (CE-003, CE-004 from W3C research)

12:05.000 --> 12:30.000
<v Eve>I can set up CloudFront. Our users in São Paulo and Tokyo have complained about latency.

12:30.000 --> 12:55.000
<v Diana>The München office also reported issues. International users definitely need CDN support.

12:55.000 --> 13:15.000
<v Charlie>I'll implement the lazy loading component. It should work with the CDN seamlessly.

13:15.000 --> 13:40.000
<v Bob>Make sure to add loading placeholders so users know content is coming.

13:40.000 --> 14:00.000
<v Charlie>Will do. I'll use skeleton screens for better UX.

14:00.000 --> 14:25.000
<v Alice>What's the timeline for these mobile improvements?

14:25.000 --> 14:50.000
<v Eve>CDN setup will take about 3 days including testing.

14:50.000 --> 15:10.000
<v Charlie>Lazy loading is probably 2 days of work.

15:10.000 --> 15:35.000
<v Diana>I'll need 1 day for mobile performance testing after implementation.

15:35.000 --> 15:55.000
<v Alice>So about a week total. We decided to target next Friday for mobile performance release.

15:55.000 --> 16:20.000
<v Bob>That aligns with the backend changes I'm making. We can release together.

16:20.000 --> 16:45.000
<v Eve>I'll coordinate the deployment. Should we do a staged rollout?

16:45.000 --> 17:05.000
<v Alice>Yes, let's start with 10% of traffic, then 50%, then 100%.

17:05.000 --> 17:25.000
<v Diana>I'll monitor error rates during each stage.

17:25.000 --> 17:50.000
<v Alice>Let's recap the action items from this meeting.

17:50.000 --> 18:15.000
<v Alice>Bob will increase rate limits and prepare the migration rollback procedure.

18:15.000 --> 18:35.000
<v Alice>Charlie will update the API documentation and implement lazy loading.

18:35.000 --> 18:55.000
<v Alice>Diana will prepare the status page update and monitor the staged rollout.

18:55.000 --> 19:15.000
<v Alice>Eve will set up CloudFront CDN and coordinate the deployment.

19:15.000 --> 19:35.000
<v Alice>And I'll send the maintenance notification and update stakeholders on timelines.

19:35.000 --> 19:50.000
<v Bob>Solid plan. Let's execute.

19:50.000 --> 20:00.000
<v Charlie>Agreed. Talk to everyone at standup tomorrow.

20:00.000 --> 20:10.000
<v Diana>See you all tomorrow.

20:10.000 --> 20:20.000
<v Eve>Thanks everyone. Bye!

20:20.000 --> 20:30.000
<v Alice>Great meeting. Adjourned.
