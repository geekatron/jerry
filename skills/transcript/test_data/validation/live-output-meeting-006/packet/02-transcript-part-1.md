## Financial Performance

<a name="seg-0011"></a>**[00:00:55.000]** Let's start with the numbers that matter most.

<a name="seg-0012"></a>**[00:01:00.500]** Our Q3 revenue came in at $18.7 million, which represents a 32% increase over Q2.

<a name="seg-0013"></a>**[00:01:06.000]** This exceeded our internal projections by 8%, and I'm thrilled to report that we're now cash flow positive.

<a name="seg-0014"></a>**[00:01:11.500]** Our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, has grown 127% year-over-year to reach $54 million.

<a name="seg-0015"></a>**[00:01:17.000]** This growth is not just about the numbers, it's about the value we're delivering to our customers.

<a name="seg-0016"></a>**[00:01:22.500]** Customer acquisition has been strong across all segments.

<a name="seg-0017"></a>**[00:01:28.000]** We added 42 new enterprise customers this quarter, bringing our total to 187.

<a name="seg-0018"></a>**[00:01:33.500]** That's a 45% increase from this time last year.

<a name="seg-0019"></a>**[00:01:39.000]** Our net retention rate stands at 132%, which means our existing customers are not only staying with us but are also expanding their usage.

<a name="seg-0020"></a>**[00:01:44.500]** This is a testament to the value we provide and the strength of our customer success team.

## Team Growth and Culture

<a name="seg-0021"></a>**[00:01:50.000]** Now let's talk about our team.

<a name="seg-0022"></a>**[00:01:55.500]** People are our most important asset, and we've been investing heavily in growing and developing our team.

<a name="seg-0023"></a>**[00:02:01.000]** We started Q3 with 782 employees and ended with 847.

<a name="seg-0024"></a>**[00:02:06.500]** That's 65 new team members in just three months.

<a name="seg-0025"></a>**[00:02:12.000]** We've been particularly focused on engineering, sales, and customer success roles.

<a name="seg-0026"></a>**[00:02:17.500]** Our engineering team has grown by 28%, which is critical for delivering on our product roadmap.

<a name="seg-0027"></a>**[00:02:23.000]** We've also made significant strides in diversity and inclusion.

<a name="seg-0029"></a>**[00:02:34.000]** And underrepresented minorities make up 27% of our team, an increase from 24%.

<a name="seg-0030"></a>**[00:02:39.500]** But we're not stopping there, we have ambitious goals to continue improving these numbers.

<a name="seg-0031"></a>**[00:02:45.000]** Company culture remains a top priority.

<a name="seg-0032"></a>**[00:02:50.500]** Our latest employee engagement survey showed an 87% satisfaction rate.

<a name="seg-0033"></a>**[00:02:56.000]** That's up from 83% last quarter and well above the industry average of 72%.

<a name="seg-0034"></a>**[00:03:01.500]** We've introduced several new programs this quarter based on your feedback.

<a name="seg-0035"></a>**[00:03:07.000]** These include flexible working arrangements, enhanced parental leave benefits, and professional development stipends.

<a name="seg-0036"></a>**[00:03:12.500]** I'm also excited to announce that we've been named one of the "Best Places to Work in Tech" by TechCareers magazine.

<a name="seg-0037"></a>**[00:03:18.000]** Looking ahead, I know there have been concerns about potential layoffs given the economic climate.

<a name="seg-0038"></a>**[00:03:23.500]** I want to be crystal clear: we have no plans for layoffs.

<a name="seg-0039"></a>**[00:03:29.000]** Our financial position is strong, with 18 months of runway at our current burn rate.

<a name="seg-0040"></a>**[00:03:34.500]** In fact, we plan to continue hiring strategically across all departments.

<a name="seg-0041"></a>**[00:03:40.000]** We're currently at 847 employees globally and plan to reach 950 by year end.

<a name="seg-0042"></a>**[00:03:45.500]** We have over 100 open positions right now, so if you know talented people who would be a good fit, please refer them.

<a name="seg-0047"></a>**[00:04:13.000]** This quarter has been all about building the foundation for our next phase of growth.

<a name="seg-0048"></a>**[00:04:18.500]** We've made significant progress on three major initiatives.

<a name="seg-0049"></a>**[00:04:24.000]** First, our platform reliability improvements.

<a name="seg-0050"></a>**[00:04:29.500]** We've reduced our average incident response time from 45 minutes to just 12 minutes.

<a name="seg-0051"></a>**[00:04:35.000]** Our system uptime has improved to 99.97%, which is a new record for us.

<a name="seg-0052"></a>**[00:04:40.500]** We've also implemented automated failover for all critical services.

<a name="seg-0053"></a>**[00:04:46.000]** This means our customers experience virtually zero downtime, even during maintenance windows.

<a name="seg-0054"></a>**[00:04:51.500]** Second, our data infrastructure modernization.

<a name="seg-0055"></a>**[00:04:57.000]** We've completed the migration of 78% of our services to the new microservices architecture.

<a name="seg-0056"></a>**[00:05:02.500]** The remaining 22% will be migrated by the end of Q4.

<a name="seg-0057"></a>**[00:05:08.000]** This architectural shift has already delivered measurable benefits.

<a name="seg-0058"></a>**[00:05:13.500]** Our API response times have improved by 40% on average.

<a name="seg-0059"></a>**[00:05:19.000]** Database query performance is up 65%.

<a name="seg-0060"></a>**[00:05:24.500]** And we've reduced our infrastructure costs by 23% while simultaneously improving performance.

## Technical Infrastructure (Continued)

<a name="seg-0061"></a>**[00:05:30.000]** Third, our security and compliance initiatives.

<a name="seg-0062"></a>**[00:05:35.500]** We've successfully completed our SOC 2 Type II audit with zero findings.

<a name="seg-0063"></a>**[00:05:41.000]** This is a major milestone that opens doors with enterprise customers who require this certification.

<a name="seg-0064"></a>**[00:05:46.500]** We've also achieved GDPR compliance across all our European operations.

<a name="seg-0065"></a>**[00:05:52.000]** And we're on track to receive our HIPAA certification by the end of Q4.

<a name="seg-0066"></a>**[00:05:57.500]** This will enable us to serve healthcare customers, which represents a significant market opportunity.

<a name="seg-0067"></a>**[00:06:03.000]** On the product side, we've shipped 47 new features this quarter.

<a name="seg-0068"></a>**[00:06:08.500]** I want to highlight a few that have received particularly strong customer feedback.

<a name="seg-0069"></a>**[00:06:14.000]** Our new workflow automation engine, which we launched in early August.

<a name="seg-0070"></a>**[00:06:19.500]** It's already being used by 63% of our enterprise customers.

<a name="seg-0071"></a>**[00:06:25.000]** The average customer has created 12 automated workflows, saving them an estimated 15 hours per week.

<a name="seg-0072"></a>**[00:06:30.500]** We also released our mobile app for iOS and Android.

<a name="seg-0073"></a>**[00:06:36.000]** Since launch, we've seen 127,000 downloads and a 4.7-star rating in both app stores.

<a name="seg-0074"></a>**[00:06:41.500]** Mobile usage accounts for 31% of all platform activity now, which exceeded our projections.

<a name="seg-0075"></a>**[00:06:47.000]** And finally, our advanced analytics dashboard.

<a name="seg-0076"></a>**[00:06:52.500]** This was our most requested feature, and the response has been phenomenal.

<a name="seg-0077"></a>**[00:06:58.000]** Customers can now visualize their data in ways they never could before.

<a name="seg-0078"></a>**[00:07:03.500]** We're seeing average session times increase by 45% as users explore these new capabilities.

## Q4 Technical Roadmap

<a name="seg-0079"></a>**[00:07:09.000]** Looking ahead to Q4, we have an ambitious roadmap.

<a name="seg-0080"></a>**[00:07:14.500]** Our engineering teams have been organized into six mission-critical initiatives.

<a name="seg-0081"></a>**[00:07:20.000]** Let me walk you through each one.

<a name="seg-0082"></a>**[00:07:25.500]** Initiative one: Complete the microservices migration.

<a name="seg-0083"></a>**[00:07:31.000]** This is our top priority.

<a name="seg-0084"></a>**[00:07:36.500]** We need to finish migrating the remaining 22% of services and fully decommission the legacy monolith.

<a name="seg-0085"></a>**[00:07:42.000]** This will unlock significant performance improvements and reduce our technical debt.

<a name="seg-0086"></a>**[00:07:47.500]** Michelle Taylor is leading this effort, and we're tracking it weekly at the executive level.

<a name="seg-0087"></a>**[00:07:53.000]** Initiative two: Launch our AI-powered automation features.

<a name="seg-0088"></a>**[00:07:58.500]** We've been working on this for six months, and it's nearly ready for beta.

<a name="seg-0089"></a>**[00:08:04.000]** The goal is to have three enterprise customers testing it by the end of October.

<a name="seg-0090"></a>**[00:08:09.500]** Early internal testing shows this could automate up to 40% of common workflows.

<a name="seg-0091"></a>**[00:08:15.000]** This has the potential to be a game-changer for our value proposition.

<a name="seg-0092"></a>**[00:08:20.500]** Initiative three: Scale our infrastructure for 3x growth.

<a name="seg-0093"></a>**[00:08:26.000]** Based on our sales pipeline, we need to prepare for significant customer growth.

<a name="seg-0094"></a>**[00:08:31.500]** We're investing in auto-scaling capabilities and geographic distribution.

<a name="seg-0095"></a>**[00:08:37.000]** This includes new data centers in Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.

<a name="seg-0096"></a>**[00:08:42.500]** Initiative four: Enhanced security features.

<a name="seg-0097"></a>**[00:08:48.000]** We're building advanced threat detection, audit logging, and compliance reporting.

<a name="seg-0098"></a>**[00:08:53.500]** These features are critical for our enterprise and government customers.

<a name="seg-0099"></a>**[00:08:59.000]** Initiative five: Developer platform and API improvements.

<a name="seg-0100"></a>**[00:09:04.500]** We're expanding our API capabilities to support more complex integrations.

<a name="seg-0101"></a>**[00:09:10.000]** We're also launching a developer portal with comprehensive documentation and SDKs.

<a name="seg-0102"></a>**[00:09:15.500]** Initiative six: Customer-requested feature backlog.

<a name="seg-0103"></a>**[00:09:21.000]** We have a prioritized list of 34 features that customers have been asking for.

<a name="seg-0104"></a>**[00:09:26.500]** We plan to deliver at least 20 of these in Q4.

<a name="seg-0105"></a>**[00:09:32.000]** Now, I want to be transparent about our priorities.

<a name="seg-0106"></a>**[00:09:37.500]** Priority one: Complete the microservices migration and decommission the legacy monolith.

<a name="seg-0107"></a>**[00:09:43.000]** Priority two: Ship the AI automation features to production with three enterprise customers.

<a name="seg-0108"></a>**[00:09:48.500]** Everything else is important, but these two items are mission-critical.

<a name="seg-0109"></a>**[00:09:54.000]** If we have to make tradeoffs, these priorities will guide our decisions.

<a name="seg-0110"></a>**[00:09:59.500]** I'm confident we can deliver on these commitments with the talented team we have.
