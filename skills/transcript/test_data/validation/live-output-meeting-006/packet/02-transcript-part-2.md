## Q&A Session

### <a name="spk-employee-five"></a>Employee Five

<a name="seg-2701"></a>**[04:30:05.000]** Thank you for the comprehensive updates.

<a name="seg-2702"></a>**[04:30:10.500]** I have a question about the AI automation features.

<a name="seg-2703"></a>**[04:30:16.000]** What's the expected timeline for general availability after the beta launch?

### Diana Martinez (CTO)

<a name="seg-2704"></a>**[04:30:21.500]** Great question.

<a name="seg-2705"></a>**[04:30:27.000]** We're planning a three-month beta period with our initial enterprise customers.

<a name="seg-2706"></a>**[04:30:32.500]** Based on their feedback, we'll make necessary adjustments.

<a name="seg-2707"></a>**[04:30:38.000]** Our target for general availability is early Q1 next year.

<a name="seg-2708"></a>**[04:30:43.500]** However, we won't rush this to market if quality isn't where it needs to be.

<a name="seg-2709"></a>**[04:30:49.000]** We'd rather delay the launch by a few weeks than ship something that doesn't meet our standards.

<a name="seg-2806"></a>**[04:35:32.500]** We also have to coordinate deployments across multiple services.
