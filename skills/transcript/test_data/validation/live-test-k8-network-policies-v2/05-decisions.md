## <a id="dec-001"></a>Decision: decision-001

### Decision Statement

**Did not recommend specific Kubernetes network implementations; provided decision tree for evaluation**

**Participants:**
- [Alex Johnson](03-speakers.md#spk-001)
- [Sam Chen](03-speakers.md#spk-002)

**Confidence:** 90%

**Extraction Tier:** tier_1

**Pattern Matched:** explicit_statement

### Context

**Primary Citation:**
- **Segment:** [seg-010](02-transcript.md#seg-010)
- **Time:** 00:00:39 (39.0s)
- **Quote:** "No, we no, we didn't. So there's a decision tree in there"
- **Speaker:** [Alex Johnson](03-speakers.md#spk-001)

### Supporting Context

**Supporting Evidence:**

1. **Analysis Methodology** - [seg-013](02-transcript.md#seg-013) (00:00:50)
   - "it looked at multiple Kubernetes network interface drivers. It did the evaluation."
   - Confirms systematic evaluation approach rather than direct recommendation

2. **Microsoft-Specific Guidance** - [seg-016](02-transcript.md#seg-016) (00:00:58)
   - "This is Microsoft's official one. This new one I recommend is because it's the one that's deprecating the official recommended Microsoft."
   - Provides context-specific guidance within the decision tree framework

- [question-003](06-questions.md#que-003) - Have specific tools been recommended?

**Related Topics:**
- [topic-002](07-topics.md#top-002) - Kubernetes Network Policy Implementation Recommendations
- [topic-003](07-topics.md#top-003) - Decision Tree and Analysis Artifacts

### Rationale

This decision clarifies the approach taken in the analysis:
- **Not Prescriptive:** No single "best" solution was recommended
- **Framework-Based:** A decision tree was provided for context-specific evaluation
- **Data-Driven:** Multiple options were evaluated against criteria
- **Context-Aware:** Microsoft-specific considerations included

The decision appears to be strategic, allowing teams to make informed choices based on their specific requirements rather than following a one-size-fits-all recommendation.
